"23A4E4B752F045D1BB4C290F2450F862",,true,"F. Scott Fitzgerald Collection","""Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940) was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are evocative of the Jazz Age, a term he coined himself. He is widely regarded as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered a member of the ""Lost Generation"" of the Twenties. He finished four novels, including The Great Gatsby, with another published posthumously, and wrote dozens of short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with despair and age. The 1920s proved the most influential decade of Fitzgerald's development.The Great Gatsby, considered his masterpiece, was published in 1925. Fitzgerald made several excursions to Europe, notably Paris and the French Riviera, and became friends with many members of the American expatriate community in Paris, notably Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway looked up to Fitzgerald as an experienced professional writer. Hemingway greatly admired The Great Gatsby and wrote in his A Moveable Feast ""If he could write a book as fine as The Great Gatsby I was sure that he could write an even better one"" (153). Hemingway expressed his deep admiration for Fitzgerald, and Fitzgerald's flawed, self-defeating character, when he prefaced his chapters concerning Fitzgerald in A Moveable Feast with: His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred. Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and their construction and he learned to think and could not fly any more because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it had been effortless. (129) Much of what Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast helped to establish the myth of Fitzgerald's dissipation and loss (of ability, social control, and life) and Zelda's hand in that demise. Though the bulk of Hemingway's text is factually correct, it is also colored by his disappointment in Fitzgerald, as well as Hemingway's own rivalrous response towards any competitor, living or dead. That disappointment was most evident in The Green Hills of Africa, where he specifically mentions Fitzgerald as an archetypal ruined American writer; Hemingway had been both shocked and unnerved by Fitzgerald's account of his own difficulties in his nonfiction essays and notebooks from the 1930s, published as The Crack-Up (with Edmund Wilson as editor) in 1945. Fitzgerald’s friendship with Hemingway was quite vigorous and as many of Fitzgerald’s relationships would prove to be. (As, indeed, were many of the thrice-divorced Hemingway's.) Hemingway did not get on well with Zelda, either. He claimed that she “encouraged her husband to drink so as to distract Scott from his ‘real’ work on his novel,"" the other work being the short stories he sold to magazines. This “whoring”, as Fitzgerald, and subsequently Hemingway, called these sales, was a sore point in the authors’ friendship. Fitzgerald claimed that he would first write his stories in an authentic manner but then put in “twists that made them into saleable magazine stories.” "" Wikipedia."

Just ask Terry Gelormino Silver, the author of Nunzilla Was My Mother and My Stepmother Was a Witch. Terry spent her formative years under the care of so-called pious nuns who acted as if her very existence was a cross to bear. For so many years she kept these memories inside, as if waiting for the proper moment in time to let them out. Well, that time has come, and it is her readers who are the richer for it.. Shining with rare insight and vivid descriptions that ably present a world most people can only imagine, this compelling memoir still manages to capture the magic of childhood and the anxiety of adolescence while granting readers a new understanding of an innocent era.. The author's experiences in three separate orphanages are examined. In the end, Terry Gelormino Silver arrives at some very interesting conclusions, some of which will surprise even those who know her best!. *****************************************. ""What I learned living in orphanages was not to snitch on others, how to use cunning to get what I wanted, how to make an angry nun laugh, how to pass time during long and boring religious services or how to avoid them altogether, gratitude for simple pleasures, mental and physical survival skills, how to gain self-esteem in non-traditional ways, and how to bluff my way through tense situations. Even in an Oliver-Twist type of orphanage, kids can manage to have fun and outsmart their caregivers. Although my book tells about some sad or angry moments, it's not a tear-jerker. Read my book, and you may be surprised to find yourself chuckling at times. Kids are irrepressible no matter what their environment."" - Terry Silver"

London's most beloved detective encounters his most deadly foe, and the results will be unlike any Sherlock Holmes adventure before it!. Some Reviews for 'The Adventure of the Solitary Grave':. ""This blending of two major Victorian characters is written in a style so seamless you can almost believe it was found in the attic of one of Doyle’s editors. Yes, it’s a little darker than I usually read, but I honestly couldn’t put it down. The nuances of Holmes, Watson, and yes, Count Vlad Dracula himself are layered and well-drawn. You’ll hold your breath, I promise. It’s quite simply the most believable Holmes/fantasy crossover I’ve ever read."" - from STEAMED! @ http://ageofsteam.wordpress.com. ""What's most remarkable about this story is the degree of authenticity Klaver gives it-- it reads just like a story by Doyle (or Watson, if you prefer!). The attention to Victorian detail is also noteworthy, and it's clear that the author knows his Holmes mythology. You may think you've seen all that can be done with teh sub-genre of ""Holmes meets Dracula"" tales, but The Case of the Solitary Grave is exciting and refreshingly unpredictable. As a bonus, we get a very touching look at the deep bond of friendship between Holmes and Watson."" - Heath Lowrance. ""I was very pleased with this short story. I am a big fan of the original Sherlock Holmes stories and of the novel Dracula. This short story was well written and was strikingly similar to the style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the original tales."" - JVib. The Supernatural Case-Files of Sherlock Holmes.

The rumblin', as described by the Camp Ranger, is terrible force, something to be feared. Phil ignores the redneck ranger's advise and heads to bed. Later that night, when a wicked storm blows in from the north, Phil and his family are forced to shack up with the rest of the campers.

Check out Jeff's other books: The Secret Tree (NEW), Creepy (The Full Collection), Twisted Vengeance, and Reunion! . In the summer of 2010, I took my family on a camping trip. We set up camp, started a fire, roasted hot dogs, and began what was supposed to be a great weekend. We knew there was a 30% chance of thunder showers but went anyway. Well, guess what? Within the first 3-4 hours of our weekend excursion, the sky turned black as night, the wind picked up and a huge wall of clouds came rushing at the campground like nothing I've ever seen before. The camp owner buzzed through the campground on a golf cart, urging all of us to come to the store basement before the storm hit. We did. . If you've ever been camping, you'll know that there are a varity of characters in a campground. With all of us packed like sardines, pets and all, the writer in me began to imagine what it would be like if we were trapped in there. What if we couldn't get out? What if a tree fell on the building and it caught on fire? What if one of the campers was a killer? Sounds crazy I know. But that's how my writerly mind works; I can't apologize for that. . While huddled up with my family, I started characterizing the other detainees and we had a few laughs. Before long, the rain dried up and we were set free. When we returned, I wrote The Rumblin'. I hope you enjoy it. It's short, but fast paced, filled with a great cast, and very suspenseful. . REVIEWS:""Reading the reviews of this book, I wondered if it was all it was hyped up to be.

Under cover of night, young ladies were spirited away from cities and town on the mainland and brought to the island for specialized training, preparing them for eventual placement in the homes of wealthy gentlemen with very specific tastes. When a pretty young redhead named Clara arrives, gagged, bound and bruised, she is assigned to Intake Cottage Number 7 and put under the strict but loving care of Nurse Ingrid.. There she is washed, fed and dressed in childish clothing as Nurse Ingrid begins teaching Clara to submit obediently to whatever demands may be made of her. Clara doesn`t know it yet but she is destined for the nursery of Lord Bardwick, a tall and demanding man who wants nothing more in life than a grown woman he may treat as a dependent child.. The first step in Clara`s training is learning to place herself, every evening and without complaint, across her nurse`s knee, where her bottom will be bared and dosed with a large and uncomfortable suppository. On Childebride Island, naughty, willful girls who don`t cooperate are punished immediately, and sound spankings and shaming with diapers are just some of the punishments meted out with alarming regularity..

A rogue nation decides to take advantage of the chaos at this time to attack America with nuclear weapons. The American intelligence network learns of the plan and the government decides to launch a first strike at this rogue nation. This information leaks out to other nations and soon the world is poised on the brink of all out nuclear conflagration as the nuclear nations choose sides in the coming conflict. As the militaries of the world go underground in preparation for the attack most of the world is blissfully ignorant of what is about to happen. There are a few exceptions to this. The civilians that are aware make plans to try to survive the attack as well. As the moment for the attack draws near, the disaster plagued planet is beset by earthquakes of unprecedented intensity and numbers. Oddly the epicenters seem to be located at every major military installation around the world. (It is implied and hinted at that divine intervention has saved mankind from nuclear war, though it is never outright stated.) When the survivors of the earthquakes look around them the next morning they see a world drastically changed. A few men and women struggle to cope with the devastation as best they can but many turn to marauding as a means of survival. Preying on any people they encounter they slaughter any that oppose them as they take anything they want. A few of the survivors band together to protect those weaker than themselves.

She had been brought up on charges upon three separate occasions for deviating from protocol. In each case her unorthodox approach saved the lives of her patients whereas following the protocols would have failed to do so therefore the Chief of Staff ordered the incorporation of her new techniques into standard treatment protocols."

TROUBLEDWhen twelve-year-old Freeman Mills arrives at Wendover, a group home for troubled children, it’s a chance for a fresh start. But second chances aren’t easy for Freeman, the victim of painful childhood experiments that gave him the ability to read other people’s minds.. Little does Freeman know that his transfer was made at the request of Dr. Richard Kracowski, whose research into the brain’s electrical properties is revealing new powers of the human mind. Kracowski is working for a secret society called the Trust, but also has his own agenda in exploring the nature of the soul. His experiments have an unexpected side effect, though. The electromagnetic fields used in his experiments are summoning the ghosts of the patients who died at Wendover back when it was a psychiatric ward.. Freeman simply wants to survive, take his medicine for manic depression, and deceive his counselors into believing he is happy. When he meets the anorexic Vicky, who may also be telepathic, he’s afraid some of his darkest secrets will be uncovered. But when the other children develop their own clairvoyant abilities, and insane spirits begin haunting the halls of Wendover, he can’t safely hide inside his own head anymore.. Meanwhile, the Trust is installing sophisticated equipment in the home’s basement, aggressively probing the threshold between life and death. And they’ve brought in another scientist who doesn’t share Dr. Kracowski’s reluctance to push the limits.. This scientist is a pioneer in ESP induction, and he performed most of his work on a very special subject: his son, Freeman Mills..

To win, she must take her father's seed money and create a successful lingerie company in one year with no help from any outside sources. Six months into it, out of money and deeply in debt, she hires a handsome hunk to make her catalog sizzle and her sales soar. But far from being a typical lingerie model, there's more to Gabriel Wallace than meets her eyes or her hands. . To My Readers: Double Exposure is a story very dear to my heart. Lacy and Gabe deserve each other, but parental interference threatens their chance at happiness. How many of us have had the same experience? I hope you enjoy reading their story as much as I enjoyed writing it. . Rating: 4/5 Stars! Heat level: H. Launching a lingerie company, Satin and Steel on a limited budget wasn't easy but for Lacy Fitzgerald it is the end of the line. She has to stand up on her feet and make her dear dad realize that he has a sensible daughter who can make effective business deals just like he does. A last minute search for a handsome hunky lingerie model brings her face to face with Gabe Matthews and she feels that his appeal as a rugged construction worker would help her to generate sales. What she doesn't know is that this particular man has lots up his sleeve that would make her fall for him in no time!. Lacy may appear a carefree young woman with only fun on her mind, but really emerges as a responsible person when the need arises. I know I should hate her father for forcing her into earning a living for herself but it turns out that parents really do know more. I never thought that Gabe would be a man to say yes when he doesn't want to but Lacy's charm makes him do things that he never meant to do. I found myself secretly smirking as Lacy's outrageous underwear made Gabe cringe. It really felt like lust at first sight, as the couple never shared their feelings for each other. True, their hot escapades make you hum with excitement but I felt love was lacking somewhere along the line. Sparks from the exciting chemistry that they share had my insides singing in no time. The plot fulfills the demands of a fun contemporary romance and you find yourself pulled in while the couple is trying on raunchy lingerie. Lacy's dear friend, Suzanne Santini is an interesting character and I wouldn't mind meeting her in her own story.. For a debut, Ms. Scott shows real promise and I expect truly dreamy delightful tales from her. Mixed identities, a hot lingerie catalog photo shoot and a daring heroine all make Double Exposure a completely adorable story that is fun to read and hard to put down!. ~~Mahaira Fatima ~ Just Erotic Romance Reviews_____________________________________________________________Lacy Fitzgerald has made a wager with her father. He will give her money to start up a business, if said business is a success in one year she wins. If the business is in the red and isn't making money she must marry Devin, the man of her father's dreams, not hers. The lingerie business she starts is failing quickly at the six month mark and she needs to pump new blood into the floundering business. That new blood comes in the form of Gabe Wallis, her new model for her lingerie. Sparks fly and steam rises between the two, but is there a future for them or the business?. Lingerie, lust, and one hot male model make for an enjoyable story. Lacy is a character that is easy to identify with. She is strong, confident, and naughty. She knows her mind and sticks with her choices. Her sexual inventiveness is downright outrageous. Gabe is sexy, strong, and has a hint of mystery about him. The sexual chemistry is combustible. The couple faces conflicts that add depth to the story. Plenty of fun with a great amount humor, the story keeps the reader interested. Ms. Scott has a knack for telling a story. I look forward to reading more!"

Scott Fitzgerald's most memorable short stories. The protagonist, Benjamin Button, is born an old man and ages in reverse until he becomes a baby and then finally vanishes from the earth. In a short introduction to the story, Fitzgerald wrote: ""This story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end. By trying the experiment upon only one man in a perfectly normal world I have scarcely given his idea a fair trial. Several weeks after completing it, I discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's 'Note-books.'"" The title story was the inspiration for the MAJOR MOTION PICTURE of the same name and remains one of Fitzgerald's most haunting and beautiful tales.. Fitzgerald's talent for short fiction is on display in this selection of four of his finest tales, chosen from two collections: Flappers and Philosophers (1920) and Tales of the Jazz Age (1922). In addition to the title story are ""Bernice Bobs Her Hair,"" a coming-of-age story about a daring young flapper; ""The Jelly-Bean,"" a story of disillusionment and love lost; and ""Dalyrimple Goes Wrong,"" a case of a character torn between self and society."

An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: A True Story (also called the Red Book).. The Bell Witch or Bell Witch Haunting is a poltergeist legend from Southern United States folklore, involving the Bell family of Adams, Tennessee. The legend is the basis of the films An American Haunting (2006) and The Bell Witch Haunting (2004), and may have influenced the production of The Blair Witch Project (1999).. According to the legend, the first manifestation of the haunting occurred in 1817 when John William Bell, Sr. encountered a strange animal in a cornfield on his large farm in Robertson County, on the Red River, near Adams, Tennessee.. This incident was quickly followed by a series of strange beating and gnawing noises manifesting outside and eventually inside the Bell residence. Betsy Bell, the family's younger daughter claimed to have been assaulted by an invisible force.. Some people believe that the spirit returned in 1935, the year when the witch claimed it would return (""one hundred years and seven"" past 1828), and took up residence on the former Bell property. . The most famous account is recorded in what has come to be called the Red Book, the 1894 An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch of Tennessee by Martin Van Buren Ingram, which cites the earlier Richard William Bell's Diary: Our Family Trouble. Richard Williams Bell lists several witnesses, including General (later President) Andrew Jackson. . That account and also an account of a related incident, The Mississippi Bell Witch account are included in this volume. Bell Witch legends are almost as prevalent in Mississippi as they are in Tennessee because of the fact that the families of two of John Bell's children moved to Mississippi in the 1830's.

Maybe it’s karma, but sparks of frustration turn into the heat of attraction and within the week the pair are involved in an interracial romance with plenty of explicit sex. . But just when things start really heating up, cruel fate steps in at Christmas vacation, when, after a second snafu, the lovebirds are separated the by an ocean of despair—the Atlantic Ocean. . EXCERPTWhen we got back to our room, Rene headed to one of the baths we would be sharing with three other students, while I simply threw on a nightshirt and hopped in bed. I just lay there and reflected on what Tami said. I'd naively thought I had my future at Juilliard mapped out. Rene would be my roommate and best friend for this year. For the next three years since the dorms were mostly for freshmen, I figured we could share an inexpensive two bedroom, New York flat. I wasn't naive, I knew those seven words, an inexpensive two bedroom, New York flat, created an oxymoron, but I'm an optimist.. In the middle of my contemplation, Rene returned. His hair, now darkened and damp, hung uncombed, but that wasn't what caught my attention. The only thing that kept him from standing naked before me was a white towel wrapped around and tucked in his waist.. He smiled. ""Turn your head, ma chere, while I put my pajamas bottoms on."". I did, but I snuck a peek. My mouth watered as he turned his backside to me and dropped the towel. His broad shoulders and muscular chest veed into a narrow waist and ultra-sexy taut buns and that wasn't all. One at a time, he lifted a foot into each pajama leg, his shoulder muscles rippling, but before he pulled them up into place, every ounce of oxygen in my lungs exhaled and my pussy muscles clenched. From betwixt his muscular legs, the underside of his sex, the tip of his penis and his pinkish mauve scrotum, beckoned to me and I couldn't catch my breath. Finally when I thought I would pass out from oxygen deprivation, I gasped a breath of life.. Rene swung around, concern etched on his beautiful face. ""Are you all right?"". My eyelids rose and I gasped again as blood rushed to my clit and pussy. His long, thick male member dangled from the opening in his pajamas.. He looked down and quickly inserted himself. ""Sorry,"" he uttered, but the damage had been done.. The damage, of course, was to my idyllic concept of how we could be platonic friends and roommates for the next four years. ""Girl, you're going to be the horniest dancer in Juilliard. And what about him? Is he supposed to go without for four years?"" What Tami had been trying to tell me slammed into my mind like a head on collision. Why hadn't this been a problem last night? Because, you idiot, you both fell asleep in your clothes after talking half the night.. He smiled. ""Are you going to sleep?"". ""If I can."". ""Would it bother you if I did some things on my computer?"". Apparently on the way to losing my mind, I blurted out, ""This wouldn't be a problem if you weren't so God damned good looking,"" and rolled over to face the wall.. ""What?"". My head turned back part way. ""Never mind, forget I said that."". The mattress sank behind me and then a tender stroke brushed my arm. ""No, mon amour, what is bothering you?"". I turned back over onto my back and raised up on my elbows. ""I'm sorry, I'm so mixed up right now, it's driving me crazy."". SUB-GENRES INCLUDED Erotic RomanceBWWMRomance and SexBDSM"

An English lord and a lovely slave find that circumstance and fate have a hand in granting those rare Arabian Pearls... Genre: Erotic Historical [contains graphic sexual content and adult language]Length: Novella  (25,000 words)5 Kisses: ""The Regency era has never been sexier than what you’ll experience in Arabian Pearl. Emma Wildes’ unique writing style is edgy and erotic. Robert’s tenderness is sweet and sexy while Celia’s acceptance of him and her situation is both moving and emotional. These two sensual characters create enough heat to warm you on the coldest of nights and will have you reaching for ice when things get too hot. I anxiously look forward to the remaining stories in the Brothers of the Absinthe Club series. If they’re anything like Arabian Pearl, I'll need to free up more space on my Keeper shelf!"" —Kerin, Two Lips Reviews5 Hearts: ""WOW!! Arabian Pearl is an amazing story. When Celia realizes the situation, she offers herself to Robert. Ms. Wildes has an incredible storytelling talent and she shows it here. Celia is a beautiful and innocent young woman who is seduced by Robert, a handsome and knowledgeable man. Their sexual encounters are beyond erotic; each night for twelve nights Robert teaches Celia something new. I was trembling in my chair as I read about their exploits. Celia grows in this story from an innocent child to an adult and sexually aware young woman. Robert knows that what he is doing is against all the rules of his society, but he does not want Celia punished and thrown into a far corner of the harem. Although they are not allowed to discuss their lives in England, they manage to get to know each other in whispers. I was simply enthralled by this story and I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys a beautiful, graphic and erotic love story."" —Marcy Arbitman, The Romance Studio5 Angels: ""This reader found Arabian Pearl a most interesting read that not only charms but titillates as well. This fascinating tale allows the reader to escape into a world of sultans, harems, and a beautiful love slave with her English lord. Even though Celia and Robert’s story is so much different from the other beautiful women in Celia’s predicament, I found my heart going out to those women who couldn’t be helped and had to suffer their fate when they were sold into slavery. Emma Wildes blends some wonderful characters, romance, and a bit of history to make a sensual read that keeps the readers interest. She paints characters with so much emotion that touch the reader, especially the poor women in bondage, yet she creates a very poignant love story between Celia and Robert that is remarkably breathtaking making this one excellent read."" —Linda L., Fallen Angel Reviews"

Additionally, someone’s hired a professional killer to keep Knighthorse permanently off the case.Meanwhile, Knighthorse’s personal life is shattered by new evidence coming to light relating to his mother’s unsolved murder...a murder dating back twenty years. Reeling from the discovery, Jim Knighthorse sets out to bring two killers to justice...His own brand of justice.. What Readers are saying:★★★★★ “To say this novel was a delightful surprise would be an understatement. I honestly loved this book and it is definitely at the top of my new favorite reads. I picked it up because I like crime fiction and mystery/suspense, figuring it would be, well, just that―a murder mystery. Instead, here’s this incredibly unique story with laugh-out-loud funny lines, an unbelievably likable narrator and a subtle touch of philosophical spirituality.” ―Amazon reviewer★★★★★ “From the first line, I was hooked. Dark Horse was an easy read with its witty dialogue and interesting characters.” ―Amazon reviewer★★★★★ “Every once in a while I come across a book that is different from any other than I’ve read―even though it is in my genre of reading, detective thrillers. This was such a book. Knighthorse is, in a word, quirky, in his methodology of going about his work, but does so in a wonderfully dedicated way. What I especially liked about the PI is his repartee style of interrogation. He’s the kind of guy who has the best comebacks that anyone could possibly have... unlike most of us that cannot think of a great rejoinder until some time after the conversation is over. Knighthorse has them all right at the tip of this tongue. His wit is enormous and dead on point all the time. Suffice it to say, this was one heck of a ride from page one to page last.” ―Amazon reviewer★★★★★ “As an avid thriller reader and reviewer, I pride myself on being on the cutting edge of new releases. How I could have missed J.R. Rain and his Jim Knighthorse is a mystery to me. (Pardon the pun.) Knighthorse is a reluctant private detective and aspiring pro-football player. He is big, strong, kind and cold and deadly. I know that sounds like a conflict of terms, but Rain makes it work, and work beautifully. Well written with believable dialog and plot-line. It was an enjoyable and nail-biting read. I plan on making J.R. Rain and his Jim Knighthorse series a staple in my Kindle library. I happily give this book a 5-star rating, and recommend it anyone looking for a new hero.” ―Amazon reviewer★★★★★ “It’s not easy being a PI, especially when police think they have a slam-dunk murderer in custody. A wise-guy with a great sense of moral direction in a California setting. Plenty of twists right to the end and well worth the time.” ―Amazon reviewerClick BUY NOW or READ FOR FREE to begin the Jim Knighthorse series of detective thrillers today!"

'Visions of Distant Shores' is a collection of stories written by award-winning science-fiction author, Andre Norton. In most of Norton's works, alienated outsiders undertake a journey through which they realize their full potential. Many planets in the books are Earth-like places, where humans can live without special protection, and have extensive flora and fauna which are described in considerable detail and often have substantial bearing on the plot.. On February 20, 2005, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, which had earlier honored her with its Grand Master Award in 1983, announced the creation of the Andre Norton Award, to be given each year for an outstanding work of fantasy or science fiction for the young adult literature market, beginning in 2006. . Nobody today is telling better stories of straight-forward interstellar adventure.. Included in this volume:Book One: Storm Over Warlock - Stranded on the alien world of Warlock, Shann Lantree's expedition camp has been wiped out by the Throgs, beings so alien that humans have yet to communicate with them. Lantree must quickly learn how to survive under harsh conditions while being chased by the Throgs -- and how to distinguish the real from the dreamed when he meets the mysterious Wyverns. A satisfying and mature novel which readers will seize upon if they want to enjoy a good adventure story.... Book Two: Star Born - When the oppressive global dictatorship of Pax took over Earth they put a stop to space exploration. Still, a few rebels escaped in the sleeper ships to found free new colonies -- or perish in the attempt. Those few colonists that reached inhabitable worlds were cut off for centuries, and in that isolation and freedom they developed the mysterious mental powers that ""civilization"" had all but destroyed.... Book Three: Star Hunter - Somewhere on the jungle world of Jumala, there was a man in hiding--a man whose mind had been reconditioned with another's brain pattern and for whom there was a fabulous reward. Star Hunter is a thrill-packed account of that other-worldly game of hide-and-seek between a man who did not know all his own powers and an interstellar safari that sought something no man had a right to find.... Book Four: Plague Ship - A fast-moving suspense tale, full of unusual detail and unexpected turns. Several highlights make the book really shine: the sunset gorp hunt on the reefs of an oily sea; a raid on an asteroid's emergency station; and a landing in the Big Burn, resulting in an encounter with the mutant life-forms that reside there.... Book Five: Voodoo Planet - Dane Thorson of the space-trader 'Solar Queen' found himself embroiled in a desperate battle of minds between the rational science of the spaceways and the hypnotic witchcraft of the mental wizard that ruled the Voodoo Planet.... Book Six: The Gifts of Asti - Varta, the last priestess of Asti, lives alone with Lur, a telepath of the lizardfolk, in Asti's isolated mountain retreat. Decadent Memphir has long since drifted away from the austere paths of Asti, and now the barbarians of Klem are sacking the city, and the smoke of its burning drifts up to the temple....

Now, in one eBook, Bantam Classics presents all fifty-six short stories and four novels featuring Conan Doyle’s classic hero—a truly complete collection of Sherlock Holmes’s adventures in crime! Volume I includes the early novel A Study in Scarlet, which introduced the eccentric genius of Sherlock Holmes to the world. This baffling murder mystery, with the cryptic word Rache written in blood, first brought Holmes together with Dr. John Watson. Next, The Sign of Four presents Holmes’s famous “seven percent solution” and the strange puzzle of Mary Morstan in the quintessential locked-room mystery. Also included are Holmes’s feats of extraordinary deception in such famous cases as the chilling “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” the baffling riddle of “The Musgrave Ritual,” and the ingeniously plotted “The Five Orange Pips.” Volume II begins with The Hound of Baskervilles, a haunting novel of murder on eerie Grimpen Moor, which has rightly earned its reputation as the finest murder mystery ever written. The Valley of Fear matches Holmes against his archenemy, the master of imaginative crime, Professor Moriarty. In addition, the loyal Dr. Watson has faithfully recorded Holmes’s feats of extraordinary detection in such famous cases as the thrilling “The Adventure of the Red Circle,” Holmes’s tragic and fortunately premature farewell in “The Final Problem,” and the twelve baffling adventures from The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. Conan Doyle’s incomparable tales bring to life a Victorian England of horse-drawn cabs, fogs, and the famous lodgings at 221 B Baker Street, where for more than forty years Sherlock Holmes earned his undisputed reputation as the greatest fictional detective of all time."

Beam Piper (Twelve Terro-Human Future History Novels in One Volume)","NOTE: This edition has a linked ""Table of Contents"" and has been beautifully formatted (searchable and interlinked) to work on your Amazon e-book reader, Amazon Desktop Reader, and your ipod e-book reader.. The Terro-Human Future History is Piper's detailed account of the next 6000 years of human history. 1942, the year the first fission reactor was constructed, is defined as the year 1 A.E. (Atomic Era). In 1973, a nuclear war devastates the planet, eventually laying the groundwork for the emergence of a Terran Federation, once humanity goes into space and develops antigravity technology.. It's important to note that many of these stories work fine as stand-alone books and you don't necessarily have to read them in order.. The story ""The Edge of the Knife"" (Book One) occurs slightly before the war, and involves a man who sees flashes of the future. It links many key elements of Piper's series.. Most of the stories take place during the next millennium, during the age of the two Federations. Most notable among these novels Little Fuzzy, which concerns the recognition of a peculiar alien species as sapient, and the efforts of the two species to learn to live together on the Fuzzies' home adopted world of Zarathustra.. The Federation collapses in the System States War and following Interstellar Wars (a bit of which can be seen in Book Eight: The Cosmic Computer), leading to a lengthy time of instability, during which there is no central human power. Space Viking is set in this chaotic period.. Piper's future history resemble in some ways Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, and was probably influenced by it.. This volume includes two of the most loved science fiction stories ever written:. Little Fuzzy--The story revolves around determining whether a small furry species discovered on the planet Zarathustra is sapient. Along the way a gentle kind of libertarianism that emphasizes sincerity and honesty is advocated. But things are not as simple or as nice as they appear to be.... Space Viking--One day, a starship rediscovered the Old Federation. Civilization had collapsed, presumably due to the war; many of the planets had regressed to varying stages of semi-barbarism. Taking advantage of the situation, space vikings proceeded to raid the poorly defended Federation worlds over the next three hundred years for loot.. In the face of this isolation and the political instability, Lucas Trask, seeks to avenge his wife's murderer and discover his true destiny.... In this volume:. Book One: The Edge of the KnifeBook Two: OmnilingualBook Three: Four-Day PlanetBook Four: Uller UprisingBook Five: NaudsonceBook Six: Little FuzzyBook Seven: Oomphel in the SkyBook Eight: The Cosmic ComputerBook Nine: Space VikingBook Ten: A Slave is a SlaveBook Eleven: Ministry of DisturbanceBook Twelve: The Keeper.

Entertainment comes in the form of a little harmless voyeurism, watching the living, breathing sex god across the quad parade around his apartment half-naked. Hailey watches and yearns, indulging in this weekly fantasy that almost--but not quite--satisfies her every desire. When Gage catches Hailey in the act of ogling him, he gives her a choice--go out with him, or he'll call the cops. But he has no intention of calling the law down on every man's wet dream. For he's been watching her, as well. And he has plans to fulfill her naughty fantasies."

To their eternal regret some people have mistaken the screams echoing in the hills as coyotes singing to the moon. When Josey drives his truck down into the valley he quickly learns the disturbing truth. It's not coyotes howling. It's men or what used to be men. Josey discovers that the valley is home to the depraved, the noble, the damned, the innocent, the beautiful, and of course the walking dead. When the least dangerous thing you encounter is an angry rattlesnake you know you've made a wrong turn at Albuquerque.. What kind of zombies are they? There has been an interesting but ultimately pointless debate going on for years about what constitutes a zombie. Is it a dead person who walks around causing mayhem? Or is it someone who is violently insane and seeks only to kill and destroy? Why not both?.

The trailer park is home to dozens of illegal immigrants, a hermit who has turned his back on society, a veteran of World War 2, a grumpy old woman, a family of Meth cookers known to local police officials as the Redneck Gourmets, and a beautiful young woman, are just a few.Life was peaceful and quiet (actually quite boring) until a deadly industrial accident killed Juan, one of the illegal immigrants.

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

This is not really a story about zombies, for of course there are no such creatures,only maybe that some people are more dead than others, and while some people may have all the luck, others have very little of it. This is an absurdist fable at heart, whose moral is that no matter where you go, there you are, even after death."

Cassandra was a young woman who hated London and Ross hated the country, yet they found themselves getting along very well. Unlike most virgins of the Regency time, Cassandra had a husband who introduced her to sex beautifully. They had amazing and arousing sex which I enjoyed immensely. I loved Ross and Cassandra; they were fun and fascinating characters. Ross and Cassandra were very well-written, with a wonderful historical background. Ms. Wildes obviously did her homework. There were interesting secondary characters who had excellent places in the story.

I found that the plot was seamless, without a single bump in the plot.

"8A7351D3242C432BBBCE269A1A0C6F80",,true,"The Playground (Singles Classic)","""The Playground"" was part of the first hardcover edition of Ray Bradbury's legendary work Fahrenheit 451, published in 1953. It is the first of Ray Bradbury's works to be authorized as an ebook.. In the story, Charles Underhill is a widower who will do anything to protect his young son Jim from the horrors of the playground--a playground which he and the boy pass by daily and the tumult of which, the activity, brings back to Charles the anguish of his own childhood. The playground, like childhood itself, is a nightmare of torment and vulnerability; Charles fears his sensitive son will be destroyed there just as he almost was so many years ago.. Underhill's sister Carol, who has moved in to help raise the young boy after his mother passed away, feels differently. The playground, she believes, is preparation for life, Jim will survive the experience she feels, and he will be the better for it and more equipped to deal with the rigor and obligation of adult existence.. Underhill is caught between his own fear and his sister's invocation of reason and feels paralyzed. A mysterious boy calls out to him from the playground, and seems to know all too well why Underhill is there and what the source of his agony really is. A mysterious Manager also lurks to whom the strange boy directs Underhill. An agreement can be made perhaps--this is what the boy tells Underhill. Perhaps Jim can be spared the playground, but of course, a substitute must be found.. ABOUT THE AUTHOR. Ray Bradbury was a rabid and devoted science fiction fan from his early adolescence and from his early years of the Los Angeles Fiction Society. He sold his first story (a collaboration with Henry Haase) to Future Science Fiction when he was only nineteen years old and by the end of the 1940s was one of the most admired science fiction writers. The irony or paradox of Bradbury's career was that it was, at least in his mind, an essential failure. Bradbury's poetic, impressionistic, surreal, and decidedly non-rational stories were deemed unsuitable by John W. Campbell's Astounding science fiction magazine, and virtually all of his early work went to second and third level magazines for publication.. In the postwar years, Bradbury's short stories found home in the so-called mainstream magazines; Mademoiselle, Charm, Redbook, Esquire, and the like, and he became the first science fiction writer to achieve some significant literary recognition through publication in Martha Foley's Best American Short Stories and the O. Henry Prize volumes. Bradbury's first ""novel""--actually a collection of related short stories compiled from work he had published in Planet, Future, and Thrilling Wonder Stories--was published by Doubleday in 1950 and has never been out of print since. It was the basis for both a television feature and a theatrical film.. The collections which followed, “The Illustrated Man” and “A Medicine for Melancholy” among others, were also successful, as was Bradbury's early novel, Something Wicked This Way Comes (also the basis for a Disney film produced in the 1980s). Bradbury collaborated with John Huston in the early 1950s on a film treatment of Moby Dick, and many of his short stories have been the basis for television and theatrical films, notably the feature-length The Wonderful Ice-Cream Suit."

And when the Sith craft crash-lands, torn and crippled, on a desolate alien planet, the hard-bitten captain finds himself at odds with desperate survivors on the brink of mutiny—and his own vengeful half brother, who’s bent on seizing command. No matter the cost, Korsin vows that it will not be his blood and bones left behind on this unknown world. For the way of the Sith leaves little room for compromise—and none for mercy."

A rogue nation decides to take advantage of the chaos at this time to attack America with nuclear weapons. The American intelligence network learns of the plan and the government decides to launch a first strike at this rogue nation. This information leaks out to other nations and soon the world is poised on the brink of all out nuclear conflagration as the nuclear nations choose sides in the coming conflict. As the militaries of the world go underground in preparation for the attack most of the world is blissfully ignorant of what is about to happen. There are a few exceptions to this. The civilians that are aware make plans to try to survive the attack as well. As the moment for the attack draws near, the disaster plagued planet is beset by earthquakes of unprecedented intensity and numbers. Oddly the epicenters seem to be located at every major military installation around the world. (It is implied and hinted at that divine intervention has saved mankind from nuclear war, though it is never outright stated.) When the survivors of the earthquakes look around them the next morning they see a world drastically changed. A few men and women struggle to cope with the devastation as best they can but many turn to marauding as a means of survival. Preying on any people they encounter they slaughter any that oppose them as they take anything they want. A few of the survivors band together to protect those weaker than themselves.

Maggie Peterson: An attractive woman in her mid thirties with short black hair worn in a short shag. Maggie had been a trauma care specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago who was known for her volatile temper and her at times unorthodox approach to saving lives. She had been brought up on charges upon three separate occasions for deviating from protocol. In each case her unorthodox approach saved the lives of her patients whereas following the protocols would have failed to do so therefore the Chief of Staff ordered the incorporation of her new techniques into standard treatment protocols."

EXCERPT:Catherine didn’t know if she wanted to tell Lord Ashworth about her retreat. She had come upon it not long after her marriage to Edgar, and it had offered her the only peace she was to know for a long time. It was dangerous to share the only thing that belonged to one. Yet the thought of spending an afternoon with the earl in her most treasured place, sharing a leisurely meal, beckoned her. She glanced shyly over her shoulder to see if he still followed.Lord Ashworth rode only a few yards behind her horse, and he grinned when their eyes met. He had a lazy, sensual smile and, when he looked at her like that, she felt an odd breathless catch in her throat.

Together, Wulf and Melina help form an alliance to save The Prime, one of the oldest species in the galaxy, and along the way discover a love so hot it sets the stars ablaze.. Melina Dmitros is a seasoned battleship captain for the Galactic Alliance. Calls from ships in distress are not all that uncommon in the outermost spirals of the Milky Way. Calls from the warlike Prime were. Now that they were allies, Mel figures she’d better get used to working in conjunction with the chauvinistic race. . She never expected to be attracted to one of them.. The Prime, one of the oldest species in the galaxy, were known for going their own way. But with problems on Cejuru Prime and increasing attacks by the Antareans, the Prime joined the Alliance to lend their expertise in battling the warlike reptilian species--and ultimately, to survive as a race.. Captain Wulf Caradoc, the eldest son and heir apparent of the Prime leader, looked forward to the trip to the Alliance ambassadorial planet. His mission is ostensibly to deliver the diplomatic team to the new Prime embassy. . His real mission is to meet his fated mate, his gemate, one of the Lost Ones..

No joke. But don’t get the wrong idea; I’m not a backwoods hillbilly, even though I do come from a long line of rednecks and hicks. There is a big difference between a hillbilly and a redneck, you know. Oh, and just to set the record straight right from the start; contrary to popular belief (i.e., the movie Sweet Home Alabama ) we don't eat bologna cake here - that's sick! I'd never even heard of it before that movie! We prefer cheeseburger pie or a fried Twinkie and, most importantly, chocolate gravy! Although that does remind me of the story my Momma told me about how my Uncle Jeremiah, when he was little, snuck some bologna into church, stood on the front pew and......OK, I'm chasing a rabbit now, as my grandpa likes to say. Back to the subject, which is me. One thing you need to know – I am going to be a big country music star one day. I know this because my great-grandma Patty Lou said so when I was just a little girl and all the family knows that her visions are surprisingly accurate. Also because I have become an overnight news sensation. You are probably wondering how a young redneck nobody could have all the news channels begging for an interview and that is what I will let you in on a little later. Oh yeah, my name. Most people wonder about my name. I was named Memphis cause that’s where I was born. And my middle name is Autumn cause I was born in late October. Momma and Daddy had gone to Memphis to look at a car and decided that they wanted to visit Graceland too. Momma’s water broke, two weeks early, right there on The King’s property. Of course that was back in the days when Momma and Daddy were still young and in love and married. They divorced last year and me, Momma and my little sister Maddie, aka – The Rat, had moved in with my grandparents ‘for a short spell’ that was turning into a long spell it seemed. So much has happened in my life in such a short time. The past couple of months could have provided material for a hundred episodes of some bizarre reality show. A redneck version of The Osbornes or Hogan Knows Best – only we are poor and nobody, except maybe Uncle Elroy and Aunt Mirtle, knows anything about wrestling…. There have been wonderful, magical moments - and some absolutely awful and painful ones. Dark secrets have been uncovered, lies have been told, hearts have been broken and miracles have occurred.

Like how I became known as The Chocolate Gravy Queen and why I consider it to be such an honor – and how I was almost murdered.

A rogue nation decides to take advantage of the chaos at this time to attack America with nuclear weapons. The American intelligence network learns of the plan and the government decides to launch a first strike at this rogue nation. This information leaks out to other nations and soon the world is poised on the brink of all out nuclear conflagration as the nuclear nations choose sides in the coming conflict. As the militaries of the world go underground in preparation for the attack most of the world is blissfully ignorant of what is about to happen. There are a few exceptions to this. The civilians that are aware make plans to try to survive the attack as well. As the moment for the attack draws near, the disaster plagued planet is beset by earthquakes of unprecedented intensity and numbers. Oddly the epicenters seem to be located at every major military installation around the world. (It is implied and hinted at that divine intervention has saved mankind from nuclear war, though it is never outright stated.) When the survivors of the earthquakes look around them the next morning they see a world drastically changed. A few men and women struggle to cope with the devastation as best they can but many turn to marauding as a means of survival. Preying on any people they encounter they slaughter any that oppose them as they take anything they want. A few of the survivors band together to protect those weaker than themselves.

In each case her unorthodox approach saved the lives of her patients whereas following the protocols would have failed to do so therefore the Chief of Staff ordered the incorporation of her new techniques into standard treatment protocols."

Well, to say that my life just wasn't going the way I wanted it to would be a vast understatement. I my twenties I accumulated over 20 speeding tickets, was fired from around 15 jobs, and went to jail 3 times. I knew I wanted to be successful and achieve my goals, but I couldn't manage to get my act together. It seemed as if there was some sort of invisible force out to get me that would appear out of nowhere and sabotage my efforts.. As it turns out this invisible force has a name and is what Eckhart Tolle refers to as the 'pain body'.. So what this looked like was me getting ready to make some sort of major transition or change in life and then simultaneously creating a reason not to make that transition or change. However, the desire to not change or transition in life was not a conscious one, but an unconscious one. In other words I consciously desired to create change in my life, but I was subconsciously sabotaging myself via all of my unhealed emotional pain from childhood.. So what happened?. I began to wake up and become self aware. It didn't happen overnight, but I did begin to witness myself in semi conscious or unconscious states; I started to see how I was unconsciously creating my reality.. Let me tell you that it's both liberating and kind of embarrassing. This is because you have amazing 'ah ha' moments of clarity when you suddenly see some of your unconscious patterns mixed with cringing moments of 'ugh' as you realize some of the things that you do and say to people that you really are unaware of.. In the end every bit of self awareness that you glean is self empowering in that it enables you to live harmoniously with the people around you and create the life that you really want.. This book will:1) Help you to utilize a greater percentage of your thinking capacity2) Help you to quit self sabotage3) Stimulate your consciousness to think in new and exciting ways4) Help your business to grow and expand5) Bring people together in large and small groups6) Help you to create a vital and balanced relationship with your wife, husband, partner, or mate7) Help you to unlock your creative freedom and bring your A game to the table in life8) Answer the question, 'What is The Secret?'9) Answer the question, 'What is Spirituality?'10)Answer the question, 'What is The Law of Attraction?'11) Teach you how to meditate12) Teach you how to manifest. Perhaps the most powerful thing about this book is that it will give you 'ah ha' moments when you read through the pages. You may begin to see, through my own personal life examples, how we all parallel each other in different ways. As it turns out many (if not all) of our life lessons are really the same, but just with different people and in different places."

"C4E1BDF3CD574B079A8C674A75864604",,true,"In The Backwoods of Nowhere","""In The Backwoods Of Nowhere"" chronicles the life of Alma Cross Owen. Alma, the fifth of nine children, was born in 1910 in lower Davidson County, North Carolina—as she says, ""fifteen miles south of Lexington, off number 8 Highway, between Newsom and High Rock, near Jackson Hill and Bald Mountain, in the backwoods of nowhere."" Alma lived with her mama and daddy, who were poor sharecroppers, in a small shack-like house on the edge of the large Reid farm that lay between Cabin Creek and Lick Creek on the Yadkin River. In her own words, Alma resurrects now forgotten times and places as she shares with us the everyday trials of life as a sharecroppers in the early 1900s. Through vivid descriptions she leads us through their daily customs folklores and hardships. She speaks of how they had to make do with what they had and how the little that they had was treasured. At age twelve Alma's family left the sharecropping way and moved twenty miles north of the backwoods to Lexington, the county seat. In Lexington her life changed dramatically. First, her one room school was replaced with more modern schools. Then, at a young age she was forced to quit school to help out the family. The biggest change came in her late teens when she met and married Odell Henderson Owen, and in the years that followed, became the mother of eleven children. During the chaotic years of raising eleven children she never forgot her upbringing, how her mama and daddy had instilled in her the importance of family, church and community. Like her daddy, she worked hard, always putting her family's needs first. And in times of personal need, she sought strength through the church .The beauty of this book is in the voice of the book—Alma's voice. Alma tells her story with a warmth that leaves you laughing at times and at other times holding a tissue to your eyes."

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Now, in one eBook, Bantam Classics presents all fifty-six short stories and four novels featuring Conan Doyle’s classic hero—a truly complete collection of Sherlock Holmes’s adventures in crime! Volume I includes the early novel A Study in Scarlet, which introduced the eccentric genius of Sherlock Holmes to the world. This baffling murder mystery, with the cryptic word Rache written in blood, first brought Holmes together with Dr. John Watson. Next, The Sign of Four presents Holmes’s famous “seven percent solution” and the strange puzzle of Mary Morstan in the quintessential locked-room mystery. Also included are Holmes’s feats of extraordinary deception in such famous cases as the chilling “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” the baffling riddle of “The Musgrave Ritual,” and the ingeniously plotted “The Five Orange Pips.” Volume II begins with The Hound of Baskervilles, a haunting novel of murder on eerie Grimpen Moor, which has rightly earned its reputation as the finest murder mystery ever written. The Valley of Fear matches Holmes against his archenemy, the master of imaginative crime, Professor Moriarty. In addition, the loyal Dr. Watson has faithfully recorded Holmes’s feats of extraordinary detection in such famous cases as the thrilling “The Adventure of the Red Circle,” Holmes’s tragic and fortunately premature farewell in “The Final Problem,” and the twelve baffling adventures from The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. Conan Doyle’s incomparable tales bring to life a Victorian England of horse-drawn cabs, fogs, and the famous lodgings at 221 B Baker Street, where for more than forty years Sherlock Holmes earned his undisputed reputation as the greatest fictional detective of all time."

The Summa's topics follow a cycle: the existence of God; God's creation, Man; Man's purpose; Christ; the Sacraments; and back to God. It is famous for its five arguments for the existence of God, the Quinquae viae (Latin: five ways). Throughout his work, Aquinas cites Augustine of Hippo, Aristotle, and other Christian, Jewish, Muslim and ancient pagan scholars.. This is an electronic edition of the complete book and includes an author biography. This book features a table of contents linked to every chapter."
