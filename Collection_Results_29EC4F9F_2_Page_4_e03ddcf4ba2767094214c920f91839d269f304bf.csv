Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul.. I finally got out of bed about 6:30 a.m. and started getting ready to go to the airport. I did everything I possibly could to keep back the tears. Packing my suitcase was so hard. I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

"6DBD92BCD80C4E00ABBCA0E3E9A205E4",,true,"Life in a Tank","TANKS!To the uninitiated--as were we in those days when we returned to the Somme, too late to see the tanks make their first dramatic entrance--the name conjures up a picture of an iron monster, breathing fire and exhaling bullets and shells, hurling itself against the enemy, unassailable by man and impervious to the most deadly engines of war; sublime, indeed, in its expression of indomitable power and resolution.This picture was one of the two factors which attracted us toward the Heavy Branch Machine-Gun Corps--as the Tank Corps was known in the first year of its being. On the Somme we had seen a derelict tank, wrecked, despoiled of her guns, and forsaken in No Man's Land. We had swarmed around and over her, wild with curiosity, much as the Lilliputians must have swarmed around the prostrate Gulliver. Our imagination was fired.The second factor was, frankly, that we were tired of going over the top as infantrymen. The first time that a man goes into an attack, he as a rule enjoys it. He has no conception of its horrors,--no, not horrors, for war possesses no horrors,--but, rather, he has no knowledge of the sudden realization of the sweetness of life that comes to a man when he is ""up against it."" The first time, it is a splendid, ennobling novelty. And as for the ""show"" itself, in actual practice it is more like a dream which only clarifies several days later, after it is all over. But to do the same thing a second and third and fourth time, is to bring a man face to face with Death in its fullest and most realistic uncertainty. In soldier jargon he ""gets most awful wind up."" It is five minutes before ""Zero Hour."" All preparations are complete. You are waiting for the signal to hop over the parapet. Very probably the Boche knows that you are coming, and is already skimming the sandbags with his machine guns and knocking little pieces of earth and stone into your face. Extraordinary, how maddening is the sting of these harmless little pebbles and bits of dirt! The bullets ricochet away with a peculiar singing hiss, or crack overhead when they go too high. The shells which burst on the other side of the parapet shake the ground with a dull thud and crash. There are two minutes to wait before going over. Then is the time when a man feels a sinking sensation in his stomach; when his hands tremble ever so slightly, and when he offers up a pathetic little prayer to God that if he's a bit of a sportsman he may be spared from death, should his getting through not violate the divine and fatalistic plans. He has that unpleasant lack of knowledge of what comes beyond. For after all, with the most intense belief in the world, it is hard to reconcile the comforting feeling of what one knows with that terrible dread of the unknown.A man has no great and glorious ideas that nothing matters because he is ready to die for his country. He is, of course, ready to die for her. But he does not think about it. He lights a cigarette and tries to be nonchalant, for he knows that his men are watching him, and it is his duty to keep up a front for their sake. Probably, at the same time, they are keeping up a front for him. Then the Sergeant Major comes along, cool and smiling, as if he were out for a stroll at home. Suddenly he is an immense comfort. One forgets that sinking feeling in the stomach and thinks, ""How easy and jolly he is! What a splendid fellow!"" Immediately, one begins unconsciously to imitate him. Then another thinks the same thing about one, and begins to imitate too. So it passes on, down the line. But there is nothing heroic or exalting in going over the top.This, then, was our possible second reason for preferring to attack inside bullet-proof steel; not that death is less likely in a tank, but there seems to be a more sporting chance with a shell than with a bullet."

While his father’s execution date looms, capital punishment is under consideration for abolishment by the state government of New York. Will seeks to influence the debate and to speed the abolishment along by framing himself for a murder he had nothing to do with—demonstrating how a simple coincidence or two can cost an innocent man his neck.. With assistance from his publisher and a defense attorney, Will succeeds in getting himself arrested for the murder before realizing the actual murderer has arranged for him to take the fall for real . . .. NYPD Homicide detective Samantha “Sam” Ortiz conducts an investigation complicated by a city on edge due to racial tensions inflamed by the murder, by a district attorney anxious to capitalize on the case in time for his reelection, by a thirst for revenge within her own police department, and by the man she’d put behind bars who belatedly insists he’d incriminated himself on purpose.. Sam must not only determine whether Will is telling the truth but also follow unexpected investigative leads involving Nazi-stolen artwork missing since WW II and illicit high-tech genetic engineering. Will she crack the case? Or will there be a family reunion on death row?. 2009 Book of the Year Award winner, YouWriteOn.com The coauthors are: Eric Christopherson, a former police officer and federal government consultant, and Brad Schoenfeld, a nationally renowned fitness expert with over 500,000 copies of his fitness books in print.. * * * * * * *.

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole, Don Dennis was a man without hope. Nothing short of a miracle could turn his life around. Of Don Dennis, Charles ""Chuck"" Colson said: ""I first met Don Dennis in Walla Walla prison. . . . He was a tough, hard con who gave his heart to the Lord and has been just as tough ever since--but now as a warrior for Christ. A wonderful example of God's grace: the One who can save a Don Dennis or a Chuck Colson can save anyone."". A portion of this book, in somewhat different form, was originally published by Broadman Press in 1993 under the title Breaking Crime's Vicious Cycle.. Excerpt from the book From the Cell to the Cross:. In 1977 Don Dennis stood at attention before a judge in a Seattle, Washington, courtroom.. ""Mr. Dennis,"" the judge began, ""you have been in and out of prison for more than twenty years. After reviewing your history of felonies, escapes, forgeries, and other crimes against society, I am sentencing you to life in prison.. That was Don Dennis, the habitual criminal. Then, he looked at life this way: ""It was me and my prison buddies at war against the police, guards, society. We were like blood brothers."" Don was more comfortable behind prison walls than in free society. Each time he went back into prison, it was like ""going home."" That's where his friends were; that's where people understood him, or so he thought.. More than twenty years later that Don Dennis was no more. He was a man with a different kind of mission. Rather than tearing down, he was building up by helping prisoners and ex-prisoners find a new way of looking at life.. This is the story of how Don Dennis got from there to here. It is nothing short of a miracle.. About the Authors. For almost twenty years, Don Dennis led a group of volunteers in a prison ministry.

Excerpt: CHAPTER II am about to take the back-trail through the Old West — the West that I knew and loved. All my life it has been a pleasure to show its beauties, its marvels and its possibilities to those who, under my guidance, saw it for the first time.. Now, going back over the ground, looking at it through the eyes of memory, it will be a still greater pleasure to take with me the many readers of this book. And if, in following me through some of the exciting scenes of the old days, meeting some of the brave men who made its stirring history, and listening to my camp-fire tales of the buffalo, the Indian, the stage-coach and the pony-express, their interest in this vast land of my youth, should be awakened, I should feel richly repaid.. The Indian, tamed, educated and inspired with a taste for white collars and moving-pictures, is as numerous as ever, but not so picturesque. On the little tracts of his great inheritance allotted him by civilization he is working out his own manifest destiny.. The buffalo has gone. Gone also is the stagecoach whose progress his pilgrimages often used to interrupt. Gone is the pony express, whose marvelous efficiency could compete with the wind, but not with the harnessed lightning flashed over the telegraph wires. Gone are the very bone-gatherers who laboriously collected the bleaching relics of the great herds that once dotted the prairies.. But the West of the old times, with its strong characters, its stern battles and its tremendous stretches of loneliness, can never be blotted from my mind. Nor can it, I hope, be blotted from the memory of the American people, to whom it has now become a priceless possession.. It has been my privilege to spend my working years on the frontier. I have known and served with commanders like Sherman, Sheridan, Miles, Custer and A.A. Carr — men who would be leaders in any army in any age. I have known and helped to fight with many of the most notable of the Indian warriors.. Frontiersmen good and bad, gunmen as well as inspired prophets of the future, have been my camp companions. Thus, I know the country of which I am about to write as few men now living have known it.. Recently, in the hope of giving permanent form to the history of the Plains, I staged many of the Indian battles for the films. Through the courtesy of the War and Interior Departments I had the help of the soldiers and the Indians.. Now that this work has been done I am again in the saddle and at your service for what I trust will be a pleasant and perhaps instructive journey over the old trails. We shall omit the hazards and the hardships, but often we shall leave the iron roads over which the Pullman rolls and, back in the hills, see the painted Indians winding up the draws, or watch the more savage Mormon Danites swoop down on the wagon-train. In my later years I have brought the West to the East — under a tent. Now I hope to bring the people of the East and of the New West to the Old West, and possibly here and there to supply new material for history. ..."

Leaning my seat back, I muttered, “Surprise me.”. Wow, I was so wet. All through dinner I kept imagining what effect I had on him. I felt like I was on display as he slid his hand up my thigh. Between the alcohol and his touch, I was ready for just about anything... at least that is what I thought.. “Why don’t we go shopping for a new toy?” I couldn’t believe it slipped out of my mouth.. We walked into an adult bookstore that I had never seen before. I felt like all eyes in the place were focused on me. I was, I guess, the only woman in the place. I watched several men walk through a curtain covered doorway near the back.. “What is that?” I asked my husband.. “Booths. Place to watch videos,” he answered.. I tugged on his shirt sleeve to indicate that I wanted to see. So, my husband grabbed my hand and walked me through the curtain. I actually felt a little more comfortable the moment I realized that we were in a long, dark hallway. I had almost felt like I was the main attraction as almost everyone in the store seemed to be staring at me.. We walked down past several booths until we found one empty. We slipped inside and made ourselves as comfortable as possible. My husband put a 5 dollar bill in and selected a movie. I sat on the bench staring at his ***. As he turned around, I instinctively reached for his ****. He grabbed my wrist and pushed it away. “Not yet.”. Confused, he explained that I was about to get the biggest surprise of my life. “Laura, tonight we shall scratch another fantasy off the list.”"

A portion of this book, in somewhat different form, was originally published by Broadman Press in 1993 under the title Breaking Crime's Vicious Cycle.. Excerpt from the book From the Cell to the Cross:. In 1977 Don Dennis stood at attention before a judge in a Seattle, Washington, courtroom.. ""Mr. Dennis,"" the judge began, ""you have been in and out of prison for more than twenty years. After reviewing your history of felonies, escapes, forgeries, and other crimes against society, I am sentencing you to life in prison.. That was Don Dennis, the habitual criminal. Then, he looked at life this way: ""It was me and my prison buddies at war against the police, guards, society. We were like blood brothers."" Don was more comfortable behind prison walls than in free society. Each time he went back into prison, it was like ""going home."" That's where his friends were; that's where people understood him, or so he thought.. More than twenty years later that Don Dennis was no more. He was a man with a different kind of mission. Rather than tearing down, he was building up by helping prisoners and ex-prisoners find a new way of looking at life.. This is the story of how Don Dennis got from there to here. It is nothing short of a miracle.. About the Authors. For almost twenty years, Don Dennis led a group of volunteers in a prison ministry. The efforts of Don Dennis Ministries were recognized with a number of awards. In 1996 he and his group were named Outstanding Religious Group of the Year by the Texas Youth Commission and the Religious Group of the Year by the Gainesville State School.

Nowadays they test you first to see if you’re psychic. Victor Bayne, the psychic half of a PsyCop team, is a gay medium who’s more concerned with flying under the radar than making waves. He hooks up with handsome Jacob Marks, a non-psychic (or “Stiff”) from an adjacent precinct at his ex-partner’s retirement party, and it seems like his dubious luck has taken a turn for the better. But then a serial killer surfaces…and no one can agree what he looks like. Solving murders is a snap when you can ask the victims whodunit, but this killer’s not leaving any spirits behind.

Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul.. I finally got out of bed about 6:30 a.m. and started getting ready to go to the airport. I did everything I possibly could to keep back the tears. Packing my suitcase was so hard. I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

For once, Cyn puts herself before her shop and lets herself be swept off her feet by a man who pursues her with a delightful vengeance. Her father’s evil girlfriend and her two lazy daughters, however, see Cyn’s new happiness as nothing more than a threat to their own comfortable lives. Their plot to break the two lovers up could turn Parker and Cyn’s “once upon a time” into a “happily never after.” Unless Cyn’s Fairy Drag Queen can pull something out of her pink-chiffon sleeve…"

This book has been formatted for optimal use on your Amazon Kindle Reader and the various free Kindle apps. From the text: There is a new age dawning in America and around the world that promises to change everything you know and the values you hold dear. The values we hold dear, like life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness form the foundation of who we are as a people and a nation. Our traditions and laws are based on these values and were originally designed to preserve human dignity. In my opinion, human dignity is as vital to life as the air we breathe and the water we drink. Without it, life perishes. As you will discover in this book, Agenda 21 believes you are a nuisance. Your very existence represents a stumbling block to a master plan that equates human life to a colony of ants, where the rights of the individual and human dignity are defined by servitude, not freedom, and where personal ambition must be expended for the greater good. We face a host of pollution and sustained development challenges, but in my opinion many of these issues can be met with free market solutions. We do not need the bloated bureaucracy of the United Nations dictating policy at the national and local levels. Let them focus on hosting summit meetings that promote world peace, and leave the rest of us alone. Agenda 21 is a carefully disguised attempt to hijack the worthy cause of environmentalism in the pursuit of political objectives. As one signatory to the United Nations’ General Assembly among at least 193 others, the initiatives being put into place in the name of sustained development represent a threat to our national sovereignty. If the citizenry of the various nations that prize freedom and self-governance do not resolve to stop the United Nations in its tracks, we will all be answering to the same handful of elites whose selfish pursuit of utopia will relegate the vast majority of the world’s population to a life of servitude and limited opportunity."

Finding out that she comes from a family sworn to eradicate his kind isn’t a deal-breaker. But her outrageous plan for him to masquerade as the wolf in hunter’s clothing, right under her father’s very nose, could be asking more than he ever expected to give.This book was previously published in ebook form only under the title Kissin’ in the Moonlight, and has been revised from its original release."

I had to keep a fan on as I read through the pages."" -- Layken, Wild on Books. [Siren Menage Amour: Erotic Western Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M] Epitome of pure evil, born without a heart, soul, or conscience...even his parents did not claim him.An outlaw who takes what he wants...The moment Devin Spawn stumbles upon the exquisite beauty bathing alone in a river, he wants her. Morality non-existent, yet he struggles to keep his distance. His sexual excesses and massive proportions would be too much for the tiny girl who appears more waifish and innocent than womanly.A widow with so much to give...The instant Megan Spawn feels his heated touch and potent sensuality, her flesh burns with wanton desires. It matters little he is the devilishly handsome outlaw known as the Devil's Spawn, the most feared, lethal gunslinger in the West -- and her stepson.Together they risk everything in the devil's playground...Where sexuality is as untamed as the bloodthirsty savages roaming the western frontier, and childhood sweetheart Caleb Walker is guilty as sin, the dark side of lust and passionate surrender comes at a hefty price when the three forge a Devil's Pact. REVIEW for Devil's Pact""Devin Spawn is an outlaw. Given away at birth by his father, Devin travels to his father's ranch to find out why. When he gets close, he comes across a tiny, beautiful woman bathing in the river. Since he has the devil inside of him, Devin does the one thing that comes natural to him--he seduces and makes her his own. There is one thing Devin doesn't know. He has just had relations with his stepmother. Megan Spawn has had a tough life. Rescued from a life of drudgery by her now deceased husband, she wants to spend her life caring for her stepdaughters and possibly being able to have a relationship with the town doctor, her first love, Caleb Walker. That is, until she is touched by the outlaw known as Devil's Spawn. Caleb Walker has loved Megan ever since she was a little girl. When his family caught them in the barn when they were teenagers and sent him away, Caleb has despaired of ever being able to be with Megan. He loves her and is willing to give her time. However, with the arrival of Devin Spawn, time may be running out because it seems that no matter how much Caleb loves her, she might not be his for the taking. Megan and Devin enter into a carnal relationship like none before. Their coming together is sensual and passionate. It is harsh and bold. But where does Caleb fit into this equation? Caleb and Devin enter into a pact, a pact where Caleb becomes part of the pair to make a triad. While Devil's Pact wasn't the tender and enchanting menage that I have grown used to reading, it still engrossed me cover to cover, and with the book being over 180,000 words, that is saying quite a lot. In all honesty, I didn't put it down. Samantha Cruise has written a menage unlike any I have read and I plan to read anything else she releases. She caught my attention with Devil's Pact and I think she will hold it for a long time."" --Talia Ricci, Joyfully Reviewed"

""Samantha Cruise cooks up a great western tale, throwing in a menage, BDSM and frequent rollicking sex for flavor."" -- Dee Dailey, The Romance Studio ** ""All I have to say about this book in two words is INCREDIBLY HOT. I had to keep a fan on as I read through the pages."" -- Layken, Wild on Books. [Siren Menage Amour: Erotic Western Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M] Epitome of pure evil, born without a heart, soul, or conscience...even his parents did not claim him.An outlaw who takes what he wants...The moment Devin Spawn stumbles upon the exquisite beauty bathing alone in a river, he wants her. Morality non-existent, yet he struggles to keep his distance. His sexual excesses and massive proportions would be too much for the tiny girl who appears more waifish and innocent than womanly.A widow with so much to give...The instant Megan Spawn feels his heated touch and potent sensuality, her flesh burns with wanton desires. It matters little he is the devilishly handsome outlaw known as the Devil's Spawn, the most feared, lethal gunslinger in the West -- and her stepson.Together they risk everything in the devil's playground...Where sexuality is as untamed as the bloodthirsty savages roaming the western frontier, and childhood sweetheart Caleb Walker is guilty as sin, the dark side of lust and passionate surrender comes at a hefty price when the three forge a Devil's Pact. REVIEW for Devil's Pact""Devin Spawn is an outlaw. Given away at birth by his father, Devin travels to his father's ranch to find out why. When he gets close, he comes across a tiny, beautiful woman bathing in the river. Since he has the devil inside of him, Devin does the one thing that comes natural to him--he seduces and makes her his own. There is one thing Devin doesn't know. He has just had relations with his stepmother. Megan Spawn has had a tough life. Rescued from a life of drudgery by her now deceased husband, she wants to spend her life caring for her stepdaughters and possibly being able to have a relationship with the town doctor, her first love, Caleb Walker. That is, until she is touched by the outlaw known as Devil's Spawn. Caleb Walker has loved Megan ever since she was a little girl. When his family caught them in the barn when they were teenagers and sent him away, Caleb has despaired of ever being able to be with Megan. He loves her and is willing to give her time. However, with the arrival of Devin Spawn, time may be running out because it seems that no matter how much Caleb loves her, she might not be his for the taking. Megan and Devin enter into a carnal relationship like none before. Their coming together is sensual and passionate. It is harsh and bold. But where does Caleb fit into this equation? Caleb and Devin enter into a pact, a pact where Caleb becomes part of the pair to make a triad. While Devil's Pact wasn't the tender and enchanting menage that I have grown used to reading, it still engrossed me cover to cover, and with the book being over 180,000 words, that is saying quite a lot. In all honesty, I didn't put it down. Samantha Cruise has written a menage unlike any I have read and I plan to read anything else she releases. She caught my attention with Devil's Pact and I think she will hold it for a long time."" --Talia Ricci, Joyfully Reviewed"

A rogue nation decides to take advantage of the chaos at this time to attack America with nuclear weapons. The American intelligence network learns of the plan and the government decides to launch a first strike at this rogue nation. This information leaks out to other nations and soon the world is poised on the brink of all out nuclear conflagration as the nuclear nations choose sides in the coming conflict. As the militaries of the world go underground in preparation for the attack most of the world is blissfully ignorant of what is about to happen. There are a few exceptions to this. The civilians that are aware make plans to try to survive the attack as well. As the moment for the attack draws near, the disaster plagued planet is beset by earthquakes of unprecedented intensity and numbers. Oddly the epicenters seem to be located at every major military installation around the world.

When the survivors of the earthquakes look around them the next morning they see a world drastically changed.

Preying on any people they encounter they slaughter any that oppose them as they take anything they want. A few of the survivors band together to protect those weaker than themselves.

Even his letters have stopped. With no news and no idea what has happened to him, Miranda goes on a search for her missing husband, accompanied only by a stray cat. On reaching her husband’s last known location, she finds the local authorities uninterested in helping to find him. Worse, some of the local citizens suspect Miranda of using magic, a treasonous offense, because of the unusual cat that has followed her on her quest. Although Miranda has always believed that magic is superstitious nonsense, she finds the circumstances of her beloved husband’s disappearance growing more and more mysterious.....

In a well-built fantasy world with a distinctly Victorian flavor, a woman's husband mysteriously disappears. . .she sets out in search of him. . .having more than her share of adventures along the way. —Roland Green, Booklist . Taylor sets this low-key fantasy in a world where magic is officially denied despite hints of its continued existence.

The fast pace, good characterization, and hint of the outcome keep readers rapidly turning the pages. A great choice for a quick read or an introduction to fantasy. –School Library Journal. A lighthouse keeper’s wife decides to look for her missing husband. Her search takes her to a distant city where she’s seen as a country bumpkin, but her sincere (and somewhat naive) determination carries her though dead ends and suspiciously unhelpful bureaucrats. Her only comfort from home is a stray cat that insists on accompanying her. But the title really refers to a different cat’s paw: Miranda is being used as a pawn in a dangerous game of intrigue, murder, and rumors of magic, which she regards as strictly superstition—at least at first. –Carolyn Cushman, Locus"

A journey across a distant time and familiar land in a haunting tale that captures your imagination and draws you into this untamable world. Beautifully written with well-crafted descriptions of life 200 years after the end of technology. In this universe the powers of the mind have been rediscovered. . This tale takes the reader into a post-apochalyptic, alternate future - and a rare friendship that grows from the bonding of a wolf shape shifter, and a human - a human who has evolved into something more than human, going beyond modern-day man and back to what we all were, what we all needed to be, eons ago, in order to survive... . This is the second novel in the shape shifter series.. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS BOOK . ""BRAVO!!!! I loved this novel. However, now I have that sadness that I always have when I finish a good book. You know, that sense of loss?? The characters are so well developed that you become involved in their quest and can't wait to know what happens next. The landscape is so rich with detail and rather eerie references to the past that it seems like a character as well. I highly recommend this book, but caution that it is not easy to put down."" . ""1. Much of the background during Melder's travels are a reminiscent of a 'western' background. 2. Is it SF or is it F? Who cares, it is good. 3. This is not just another catastrophe novel, but the scenes where Melder encounters the ruined remains of our civilization are nice and spooky."" . ""Melder was an exceptional adventure fantasy novel. It has everything you would expect in either genre. I was hooked from the beginning when the melder saved the wolf, and the entire book was a wonderful journey for me as I followed along with the two on their quest. This marvelous story had suspense, humor and delightful characters. I highly recommend this book."" . ""Melder, is refreshingly different. Oh sure, post-apocolypse books have been written, but this book doesn't focus that much on destruction. Rather, it hands it over in poignant moments and snapshots of regret for a rich farm valley that became a wasteland, and mournful sorrow over a family huddled together in their last moments. Those moments are thankfully brief. This book is about a quest, and hope, and a new way of life springing from the ashes like a newborn phoenix. It's about the joy of discovering new friendships and the growth of one's skills. It's about the comfort of companionship and respect for each other's differences. It has some surprising twists and intriguing mysteries. It has questions. The chapters are short which I find make reading faster and also make it easier to put the bookmark in when I have to, which I've come to regret more and more each time I have to do it. My husband accused me of being anti-social. I wish he was a reader so he'd understand what it is to be so engrossed in a good book that everything around you disappears. Those of you who've read this book know all this already. I've kept my review purposely vague for those who haven't read it yet. I hope that you will read it next. To Kathy, thank you for a vivid, comforting, refreshing read that has added moments of hope and humor to my days."""

Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul.. I finally got out of bed about 6:30 a.m. and started getting ready to go to the airport. I did everything I possibly could to keep back the tears. Packing my suitcase was so hard. I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Written by a retired Naval Aviator and former Paratrooper; the author puts the reader in the F-4F Wildcat and jungle, as warriors engage in a titanic struggle around the globe.

A journey across a distant time and familiar land in a haunting tale that captures your imagination and draws you into this untamable world. Beautifully written with well-crafted descriptions of life 200 years after the end of technology. In this universe the powers of the mind have been rediscovered. . This tale takes the reader into a post-apochalyptic, alternate future - and a rare friendship that grows from the bonding of a wolf shape shifter, and a human - a human who has evolved into something more than human, going beyond modern-day man and back to what we all were, what we all needed to be, eons ago, in order to survive... . This is the second novel in the shape shifter series.. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS BOOK . ""BRAVO!!!! I loved this novel. However, now I have that sadness that I always have when I finish a good book. You know, that sense of loss?? The characters are so well developed that you become involved in their quest and can't wait to know what happens next. The landscape is so rich with detail and rather eerie references to the past that it seems like a character as well. I highly recommend this book, but caution that it is not easy to put down."" . ""1. Much of the background during Melder's travels are a reminiscent of a 'western' background. 2. Is it SF or is it F? Who cares, it is good. 3. This is not just another catastrophe novel, but the scenes where Melder encounters the ruined remains of our civilization are nice and spooky."" . ""Melder was an exceptional adventure fantasy novel. It has everything you would expect in either genre. I was hooked from the beginning when the melder saved the wolf, and the entire book was a wonderful journey for me as I followed along with the two on their quest. This marvelous story had suspense, humor and delightful characters. I highly recommend this book."" . ""Melder, is refreshingly different. Oh sure, post-apocolypse books have been written, but this book doesn't focus that much on destruction. Rather, it hands it over in poignant moments and snapshots of regret for a rich farm valley that became a wasteland, and mournful sorrow over a family huddled together in their last moments. Those moments are thankfully brief. This book is about a quest, and hope, and a new way of life springing from the ashes like a newborn phoenix. It's about the joy of discovering new friendships and the growth of one's skills. It's about the comfort of companionship and respect for each other's differences. It has some surprising twists and intriguing mysteries. It has questions. The chapters are short which I find make reading faster and also make it easier to put the bookmark in when I have to, which I've come to regret more and more each time I have to do it. My husband accused me of being anti-social. I wish he was a reader so he'd understand what it is to be so engrossed in a good book that everything around you disappears. Those of you who've read this book know all this already. I've kept my review purposely vague for those who haven't read it yet. I hope that you will read it next. To Kathy, thank you for a vivid, comforting, refreshing read that has added moments of hope and humor to my days."""

On reaching her husband’s last known location, she finds the local authorities uninterested in helping to find him. Worse, some of the local citizens suspect Miranda of using magic, a treasonous offense, because of the unusual cat that has followed her on her quest.

Taylor sets this low-key fantasy in a world where magic is officially denied despite hints of its continued existence.

The fast pace, good characterization, and hint of the outcome keep readers rapidly turning the pages. A great choice for a quick read or an introduction to fantasy. –School Library Journal. A lighthouse keeper’s wife decides to look for her missing husband. Her search takes her to a distant city where she’s seen as a country bumpkin, but her sincere (and somewhat naive) determination carries her though dead ends and suspiciously unhelpful bureaucrats. Her only comfort from home is a stray cat that insists on accompanying her. But the title really refers to a different cat’s paw: Miranda is being used as a pawn in a dangerous game of intrigue, murder, and rumors of magic, which she regards as strictly superstition—at least at first. –Carolyn Cushman, Locus"

A journey across a distant time and familiar land in a haunting tale that captures your imagination and draws you into this untamable world. Beautifully written with well-crafted descriptions of life 200 years after the end of technology. In this universe the powers of the mind have been rediscovered. . This tale takes the reader into a post-apochalyptic, alternate future - and a rare friendship that grows from the bonding of a wolf shape shifter, and a human - a human who has evolved into something more than human, going beyond modern-day man and back to what we all were, what we all needed to be, eons ago, in order to survive... . This is the second novel in the shape shifter series.. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS BOOK . ""BRAVO!!!! I loved this novel. However, now I have that sadness that I always have when I finish a good book. You know, that sense of loss?? The characters are so well developed that you become involved in their quest and can't wait to know what happens next. The landscape is so rich with detail and rather eerie references to the past that it seems like a character as well. I highly recommend this book, but caution that it is not easy to put down."" . ""1. Much of the background during Melder's travels are a reminiscent of a 'western' background. 2. Is it SF or is it F? Who cares, it is good. 3. This is not just another catastrophe novel, but the scenes where Melder encounters the ruined remains of our civilization are nice and spooky."" . ""Melder was an exceptional adventure fantasy novel. It has everything you would expect in either genre. I was hooked from the beginning when the melder saved the wolf, and the entire book was a wonderful journey for me as I followed along with the two on their quest. This marvelous story had suspense, humor and delightful characters. I highly recommend this book."" . ""Melder, is refreshingly different. Oh sure, post-apocolypse books have been written, but this book doesn't focus that much on destruction. Rather, it hands it over in poignant moments and snapshots of regret for a rich farm valley that became a wasteland, and mournful sorrow over a family huddled together in their last moments. Those moments are thankfully brief. This book is about a quest, and hope, and a new way of life springing from the ashes like a newborn phoenix. It's about the joy of discovering new friendships and the growth of one's skills. It's about the comfort of companionship and respect for each other's differences. It has some surprising twists and intriguing mysteries. It has questions. The chapters are short which I find make reading faster and also make it easier to put the bookmark in when I have to, which I've come to regret more and more each time I have to do it. My husband accused me of being anti-social. I wish he was a reader so he'd understand what it is to be so engrossed in a good book that everything around you disappears. Those of you who've read this book know all this already. I've kept my review purposely vague for those who haven't read it yet. I hope that you will read it next. To Kathy, thank you for a vivid, comforting, refreshing read that has added moments of hope and humor to my days."""

"0C274A7716AD4878976B998257B4F458",,true,"Life in a Tank","TANKS!To the uninitiated--as were we in those days when we returned to the Somme, too late to see the tanks make their first dramatic entrance--the name conjures up a picture of an iron monster, breathing fire and exhaling bullets and shells, hurling itself against the enemy, unassailable by man and impervious to the most deadly engines of war; sublime, indeed, in its expression of indomitable power and resolution.This picture was one of the two factors which attracted us toward the Heavy Branch Machine-Gun Corps--as the Tank Corps was known in the first year of its being. On the Somme we had seen a derelict tank, wrecked, despoiled of her guns, and forsaken in No Man's Land. We had swarmed around and over her, wild with curiosity, much as the Lilliputians must have swarmed around the prostrate Gulliver. Our imagination was fired.The second factor was, frankly, that we were tired of going over the top as infantrymen. The first time that a man goes into an attack, he as a rule enjoys it. He has no conception of its horrors,--no, not horrors, for war possesses no horrors,--but, rather, he has no knowledge of the sudden realization of the sweetness of life that comes to a man when he is ""up against it."" The first time, it is a splendid, ennobling novelty. And as for the ""show"" itself, in actual practice it is more like a dream which only clarifies several days later, after it is all over. But to do the same thing a second and third and fourth time, is to bring a man face to face with Death in its fullest and most realistic uncertainty. In soldier jargon he ""gets most awful wind up."" It is five minutes before ""Zero Hour."" All preparations are complete. You are waiting for the signal to hop over the parapet. Very probably the Boche knows that you are coming, and is already skimming the sandbags with his machine guns and knocking little pieces of earth and stone into your face. Extraordinary, how maddening is the sting of these harmless little pebbles and bits of dirt! The bullets ricochet away with a peculiar singing hiss, or crack overhead when they go too high. The shells which burst on the other side of the parapet shake the ground with a dull thud and crash. There are two minutes to wait before going over. Then is the time when a man feels a sinking sensation in his stomach; when his hands tremble ever so slightly, and when he offers up a pathetic little prayer to God that if he's a bit of a sportsman he may be spared from death, should his getting through not violate the divine and fatalistic plans. He has that unpleasant lack of knowledge of what comes beyond. For after all, with the most intense belief in the world, it is hard to reconcile the comforting feeling of what one knows with that terrible dread of the unknown.A man has no great and glorious ideas that nothing matters because he is ready to die for his country. He is, of course, ready to die for her. But he does not think about it. He lights a cigarette and tries to be nonchalant, for he knows that his men are watching him, and it is his duty to keep up a front for their sake. Probably, at the same time, they are keeping up a front for him. Then the Sergeant Major comes along, cool and smiling, as if he were out for a stroll at home. Suddenly he is an immense comfort. One forgets that sinking feeling in the stomach and thinks, ""How easy and jolly he is! What a splendid fellow!"" Immediately, one begins unconsciously to imitate him. Then another thinks the same thing about one, and begins to imitate too. So it passes on, down the line. But there is nothing heroic or exalting in going over the top.This, then, was our possible second reason for preferring to attack inside bullet-proof steel; not that death is less likely in a tank, but there seems to be a more sporting chance with a shell than with a bullet."

The intrepid American heroine of WALKING INTO MURDER, professor Laura Morland, would have scoffed at the idea. All she wanted was a few days of peace to recover from a humiliating (if not entirely unwelcome) divorce and a chance to test her new independence. That she certainly does; peace is another matter.. WALKING INTO MURDER is a light-hearted mystery with a delightful setting, an intriguing plot and distinctive characters headed by Laura Morland, a wonderfully appealing new amateur detective. It is part traditional English mystery, part middle-aged female sleuth of independent spirit who solves mysteries that confound the experts, part primer on the the battle between the sexes since Laura is an expert on gender, part rousing adventure. Laura is hardly Miss Marple - she is younger, more active, attractive, even romantically inclined, but the settings and characters are very British indeed. . It's a wonderful read: spine-tingling escapes and confrontations on deserted moors contrast with peaceful interludes in England's quaintest villages and most verdant countryside - and with some near-comic scenes of Laura's inept but ultimately successful efforts to track down the villains even as she eludes their clutches. Mask-making, amateur theatrics, underground tunnels and an escape from a boarded-up cottage are all part of the action. The adventure begins when Laura is invited to teach a seminar on gender issues in London. First she decides to embark on a solo walking trip on the Cotswold Way. The walk soon takes stormy turns. A man plummets out of the thick mist, hauls her into an embrace and begs her to masquerade as his wife. Escorted at gunpoint by an aristocratic Englishman to an ancient manor house, she is confronted by a roomful of eccentrics, any of whom could be the killer of the body she finds in a bedroom - a body that perversely keeps changing its identity. In fact, everyone in in this bizarre household seems to have multiple identities and multiple motivations, making it exceedingly difficult to determine who is telling the truth and even harder to ascertain who is on Laura's side.. Curiosity is Laura's dominant trait and she delves into the mystery with possibly unwise abandon. She is determined to unmask the murderer - and to get the best of her alternately charming and irritating would-be husband, to whom she is undeniably attracted. She soon discovers that her fund of scholarly knowledge about male/female relationships is of little help in dealing with a man who refuses to answer her questions, appears to be having a steamy affair with the titled Lady of the house, and who increasingly seems the most likely candidate for murderer. Complicating matters further is his fraught relationship with Laura's able assistant in crime-detection, a fiery, free-spirited runaway who lives in the woods.. As Laura probes deeper, the efforts of the villains to silence her become more frantic and her strategies to evade them more ingenious. With total disregard for the escalating danger, she vows to outwit them all. And she does. In a final dramatic - and totally unexpected - scene, she zeroes in on the killer, or it might be more accurate to say the murderer zeroes in on her.. Joan Dahr Lambert is the author of CIRCLES OF STONE, a prehistoric novel told through the eyes of three women who became leaders of their tribes, and published by Simon & Schuster in 1997 & 1999.

Of Don Dennis, Charles ""Chuck"" Colson said: ""I first met Don Dennis in Walla Walla prison. . . . He was a tough, hard con who gave his heart to the Lord and has been just as tough ever since--but now as a warrior for Christ. A wonderful example of God's grace: the One who can save a Don Dennis or a Chuck Colson can save anyone."". A portion of this book, in somewhat different form, was originally published by Broadman Press in 1993 under the title Breaking Crime's Vicious Cycle.. Excerpt from the book From the Cell to the Cross:. In 1977 Don Dennis stood at attention before a judge in a Seattle, Washington, courtroom.. ""Mr. Dennis,"" the judge began, ""you have been in and out of prison for more than twenty years. After reviewing your history of felonies, escapes, forgeries, and other crimes against society, I am sentencing you to life in prison.. That was Don Dennis, the habitual criminal. Then, he looked at life this way: ""It was me and my prison buddies at war against the police, guards, society. We were like blood brothers."" Don was more comfortable behind prison walls than in free society. Each time he went back into prison, it was like ""going home."" That's where his friends were; that's where people understood him, or so he thought.. More than twenty years later that Don Dennis was no more. He was a man with a different kind of mission. Rather than tearing down, he was building up by helping prisoners and ex-prisoners find a new way of looking at life.. This is the story of how Don Dennis got from there to here. It is nothing short of a miracle.. About the Authors. For almost twenty years, Don Dennis led a group of volunteers in a prison ministry. The efforts of Don Dennis Ministries were recognized with a number of awards. In 1996 he and his group were named Outstanding Religious Group of the Year by the Texas Youth Commission and the Religious Group of the Year by the Gainesville State School. In 1997 he received the Governor's Faithful Service Award from Texas Governor George Bush. This was followed in 1998 with the Governor's Volunteer Service Award for Faithfulness to the Texas Youth Commission..

Now, in one eBook, Bantam Classics presents all fifty-six short stories and four novels featuring Conan Doyle’s classic hero—a truly complete collection of Sherlock Holmes’s adventures in crime! Volume I includes the early novel A Study in Scarlet, which introduced the eccentric genius of Sherlock Holmes to the world. This baffling murder mystery, with the cryptic word Rache written in blood, first brought Holmes together with Dr. John Watson. Next, The Sign of Four presents Holmes’s famous “seven percent solution” and the strange puzzle of Mary Morstan in the quintessential locked-room mystery. Also included are Holmes’s feats of extraordinary deception in such famous cases as the chilling “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” the baffling riddle of “The Musgrave Ritual,” and the ingeniously plotted “The Five Orange Pips.” Volume II begins with The Hound of Baskervilles, a haunting novel of murder on eerie Grimpen Moor, which has rightly earned its reputation as the finest murder mystery ever written. The Valley of Fear matches Holmes against his archenemy, the master of imaginative crime, Professor Moriarty. In addition, the loyal Dr. Watson has faithfully recorded Holmes’s feats of extraordinary detection in such famous cases as the thrilling “The Adventure of the Red Circle,” Holmes’s tragic and fortunately premature farewell in “The Final Problem,” and the twelve baffling adventures from The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. Conan Doyle’s incomparable tales bring to life a Victorian England of horse-drawn cabs, fogs, and the famous lodgings at 221 B Baker Street, where for more than forty years Sherlock Holmes earned his undisputed reputation as the greatest fictional detective of all time."

The fantastic tales that the townsfolk tell about the Ac-Taw, a clan of people who can shift into animals, are nothing but folklore. Or are they? Burke is stunned by his response to Rachel, and even more so when she innocently shows signs of possessing Ac-Taw blood. And this puts her in more danger than she knows, danger that only increases the urgency to mark her as his own. Rachel comes to realize she's inherited much more than just property. She has also inherited a destiny to protect her newfound home. For the Ac-Taw aren't just legend-they're real."

A rogue nation decides to take advantage of the chaos at this time to attack America with nuclear weapons. The American intelligence network learns of the plan and the government decides to launch a first strike at this rogue nation. This information leaks out to other nations and soon the world is poised on the brink of all out nuclear conflagration as the nuclear nations choose sides in the coming conflict.

The civilians that are aware make plans to try to survive the attack as well. As the moment for the attack draws near, the disaster plagued planet is beset by earthquakes of unprecedented intensity and numbers.

This memoir is not just the story of one family in the stark days of the Great Depression. Its experience is framed by the author, an economist, year by year against the background of President Hoover’s failed policies and Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. . In the preface the author sees more than a personal reason for telling his story: “…since the United States may continue on the brink of another Great Depression or a long-term Recession, this witness from one of the last survivors of the Great Depression of the 1930s might serve as a warning about the enduring damage caused by the poison of poverty, and an urgent plea for bold initiatives to avoid more pain.” . Don Croton’s educational background includes a Master's Degree in Economics from Columbia University and studies towards a doctorate in Economics at the University of Michigan. His working experience includes Teaching Fellow at the University of Michigan, economist for several major corporations, a two-year assignment from the Rockefeller Brothers' Fund to develop employment opportunities in impoverished areas of the United States, and ten years as a management consultant specializing in strategic planning.
