This time, the stakes are her trust fund, her freedom, and even her single status. To win, she must take her father's seed money and create a successful lingerie company in one year with no help from any outside sources. Six months into it, out of money and deeply in debt, she hires a handsome hunk to make her catalog sizzle and her sales soar. But far from being a typical lingerie model, there's more to Gabriel Wallace than meets her eyes or her hands. . To My Readers: Double Exposure is a story very dear to my heart. Lacy and Gabe deserve each other, but parental interference threatens their chance at happiness. How many of us have had the same experience? I hope you enjoy reading their story as much as I enjoyed writing it. . Rating: 4/5 Stars! Heat level: H. Launching a lingerie company, Satin and Steel on a limited budget wasn't easy but for Lacy Fitzgerald it is the end of the line. She has to stand up on her feet and make her dear dad realize that he has a sensible daughter who can make effective business deals just like he does. A last minute search for a handsome hunky lingerie model brings her face to face with Gabe Matthews and she feels that his appeal as a rugged construction worker would help her to generate sales. What she doesn't know is that this particular man has lots up his sleeve that would make her fall for him in no time!. Lacy may appear a carefree young woman with only fun on her mind, but really emerges as a responsible person when the need arises. I know I should hate her father for forcing her into earning a living for herself but it turns out that parents really do know more. I never thought that Gabe would be a man to say yes when he doesn't want to but Lacy's charm makes him do things that he never meant to do. I found myself secretly smirking as Lacy's outrageous underwear made Gabe cringe. It really felt like lust at first sight, as the couple never shared their feelings for each other. True, their hot escapades make you hum with excitement but I felt love was lacking somewhere along the line. Sparks from the exciting chemistry that they share had my insides singing in no time. The plot fulfills the demands of a fun contemporary romance and you find yourself pulled in while the couple is trying on raunchy lingerie. Lacy's dear friend, Suzanne Santini is an interesting character and I wouldn't mind meeting her in her own story.. For a debut, Ms. Scott shows real promise and I expect truly dreamy delightful tales from her. Mixed identities, a hot lingerie catalog photo shoot and a daring heroine all make Double Exposure a completely adorable story that is fun to read and hard to put down!. ~~Mahaira Fatima ~ Just Erotic Romance Reviews_____________________________________________________________Lacy Fitzgerald has made a wager with her father. He will give her money to start up a business, if said business is a success in one year she wins. If the business is in the red and isn't making money she must marry Devin, the man of her father's dreams, not hers. The lingerie business she starts is failing quickly at the six month mark and she needs to pump new blood into the floundering business. That new blood comes in the form of Gabe Wallis, her new model for her lingerie. Sparks fly and steam rises between the two, but is there a future for them or the business?. Lingerie, lust, and one hot male model make for an enjoyable story. Lacy is a character that is easy to identify with. She is strong, confident, and naughty. She knows her mind and sticks with her choices. Her sexual inventiveness is downright outrageous. Gabe is sexy, strong, and has a hint of mystery about him. The sexual chemistry is combustible. The couple faces conflicts that add depth to the story. Plenty of fun with a great amount humor, the story keeps the reader interested. Ms. Scott has a knack for telling a story. I look forward to reading more!"

Detective Joe Muller observes human behaviour closely and absorbs atmosphere to draw his conclusions but is also capable of using disguise and subterfuge.. Joseph Muller, Secret Service detective of the Imperial Austrian police, is one of the great experts in his profession. In personality he differs greatly from other famous detectives.

Muller is a small, slight, plain-looking man, of indefinite age, and of much humbleness of mien. A naturally retiring, modest disposition, and two external causes are the reasons for Muller’s humbleness of manner, which is his chief characteristic. One cause is the fact that in early youth a miscarriage of justice gave him several years in prison, an experience which cast a stigma on his name and which made it impossible for him, for many years after, to obtain honest employment.. But the world is richer, and safer, by Muller’s early misfortune....

Parker and Robert Crais fans will enjoy 2011 ""Best Novel"" nominee Hallinan's overeducated private eye, Simeon Grist. In the second book in Hallinan's cult series, originally published in the 1990s, Grist takes a case, that leads him to the phantom neighborhoods of L.A.'s lost children.. Missing thirteen-year-old Aimee Sorrell, who ran all the way from Kansas to be a star. But Aimee's trail soon leads Simeon to the city morgue, the first stop on a perilous journey to find out what happens to America's lost children when they go looking for love in all the wrong places.. *From Publishers WeeklySimeon Grist, seen before in The Four Last Things , is an up-to-date private eye, a hip survivor of the Woodstock Generation bemused by current L.A. life. He's also a bit seedy, drinking too much and backsliding into cigarette smoking, with a wry outlook and heart of gold that keep him squarely in the hardboiled Hammett-Chandler tradition. Hired to find a 13-year-old runaway who left Kansas to become a Hollywood star, Simeon soon finds himself mired in L.A.'s seamy underworld of teenage hustlers, pimps and all-around losers. Using as decoys his teenage godchild Jessica and a young computer whiz smitten by her, Simeon uncovers a vast interstate ring involving a talent agency, a bent cop and high-tech kiddy-sex. While providing a nasty new meaning for a computer ""menu"" and some scenes not for the squeamish, Hallinan employs skillful pacing, L.A. color and Simeon's attractive persona to grip readers right through the gory climax and somewhat reassuring ending. Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc. . *From BooklistHallinan's first novel, The Four Last Things, introduced Southern California professor-turned-private-eye Simeon Grist and was notable for its superior plot, dialogue, and characterizations. The second Grist novel is as entertaining as the first, although its subject matter – child prostitution – is hardly light. Hired to find Aimee Sorrell, a 13-year-old runaway from Kansas City who has been kidnapped, Grist attempts to get a lead by hanging out with the young hookers and pimps who frequent the area between Sunset and Fountin Boulevards in Hollywood. His discoveries lead, first, to a strange alliance with the bizarre Mountain (a self-appointed guardian angel who tries to convince the runaways to go home) and, next, to the recruiting of Grist's goddaughter, Jessica, and her computer-nerd friend, Morris, to assist in the hunt for Aimee. Hallinan once again supplies a riveting story, and Grist continues to be one of the most intriguing of the new private eyes. Be forewarned, though: the denoument is grim indeed.. *From Library JournalSimeon Grist, persistently hard-nosed private eye, searches the draggy side of Los Angeles for a little lost rich girl. The 12-year-old's mother has received obscene pictures and a ransom note of sorts, so Grist, disgusted and enraged, dives into a graphic world of teenage prostitution, drug abuse, instant violence, colorful street people, and odious exploitation. By treating a grimly fascinating subject matter and location with sharp-voiced style and verve, Hallinan rises far above his first effort, The Four Last Things .Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc. . “Squeal combines high-octane action, baroque violence, humor, and pathos in a self-assured manner that marks Mr. Hallinan as a capable practitioner of the private eye tale.

A rogue nation decides to take advantage of the chaos at this time to attack America with nuclear weapons. The American intelligence network learns of the plan and the government decides to launch a first strike at this rogue nation. This information leaks out to other nations and soon the world is poised on the brink of all out nuclear conflagration as the nuclear nations choose sides in the coming conflict.

Her mind was spinning like a whirlpool. Far below, the majesty of the moonlit valleys and the hue of colors reflecting from the rocky snow-capped ridges unfolded before them. Clover marveled at the dozens of rivers and streams that glittered like strands and pools of molten gold. The force of the air pressed hard against her as Crimzon dove. She began to feel dizzy and distant, but before she slipped into unconsciousness, the dragon leveled out and sped them across the treetops at such speed that all Clover could see below was a shadowy blur. Soon their momentum died away and Crimzon began to circle and rise again, but now at a more relaxed pace. Clover was glad. She felt rubbery and nauseated. Sick or not she had to admit that it was the most exhilarating experience she had ever had. Also available: Crimzon & Clover II - The Tricky Wizard. A flash fiction short story called 'The Blood of Coldfrost' and a short preview of 'The Royal Dragoneers' novel are included in this download as well."

Once, long ago, there was one Earth. It was said that many deities gazed down upon it protectively, and there was balance between them all. Then something went wrong. The balance shifted—toward darkness. Earth was shattered, her people destroyed, her remains scattered far and wide. But the gods survived the cataclysm. They scattered as well, each pursuing a fragment of their former domain. And, when they overtook those shards, the gods drew upon what power remained to them to restore their worshippers to life.. These new followers rose from dust and imperfect memory, for the gods too had been injured. Each claimed a new home, and a new life, and each thought itself—at least at first—to be the only Earth. All memory of their former world was lost, except vague memories of the gods who gave them new life. Then, one day, a single great event drew all their eyes to the stars—and beyond. And each of them felt a yearning. Something in them desired to be whole again, or at least to understand. These are their stories.. These are The Tales of the Scattered Earth.. THE BIRTH OF THE DREAD REMORA. Nathaniel Demming is a midshipman aboard the HMES Remora, the first ship to go beyond their world's waters and out into the ether. He and the rest of the crew are ready for adventure, eager to explore the unknown and chart a new course for the rest of their world to follow. But what they found changed their lives, and their perspective, forever. The ether was not empty at all, but teeming with life--including vicious marauders waiting to prey upon the hapless Remora. Can Demming help his friends and fellow officers through the crises that await? Can they survive the dangers that surround them? And can he convince them to transform their ship and themselves into the antithesis of everything they trained for, while still holding true to everything they believe in?. THE BIRTH OF THE DREAD REMORA is the first tale of the epic Scattered Earth saga, and the first in a series of swashbuckling adventures about the space-pirate ship the Dread Remora! Also available in the Dread Remora Cycle, HONOR OF THE DREAD REMORA, and Crossed Paths. Next in line is David Niall Wilson's THE SECOND VEIL, and then Keith R. A. DeCandido's GUILT IN INNOCENCE.

"4A0733D95FAC4A118361EBACB19B7769",,true,"F. Scott Fitzgerald Collection","""Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940) was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are evocative of the Jazz Age, a term he coined himself. He is widely regarded as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered a member of the ""Lost Generation"" of the Twenties. He finished four novels, including The Great Gatsby, with another published posthumously, and wrote dozens of short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with despair and age. The 1920s proved the most influential decade of Fitzgerald's development.The Great Gatsby, considered his masterpiece, was published in 1925. Fitzgerald made several excursions to Europe, notably Paris and the French Riviera, and became friends with many members of the American expatriate community in Paris, notably Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway looked up to Fitzgerald as an experienced professional writer. Hemingway greatly admired The Great Gatsby and wrote in his A Moveable Feast ""If he could write a book as fine as The Great Gatsby I was sure that he could write an even better one"" (153). Hemingway expressed his deep admiration for Fitzgerald, and Fitzgerald's flawed, self-defeating character, when he prefaced his chapters concerning Fitzgerald in A Moveable Feast with: His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred. Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and their construction and he learned to think and could not fly any more because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it had been effortless. (129) Much of what Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast helped to establish the myth of Fitzgerald's dissipation and loss (of ability, social control, and life) and Zelda's hand in that demise. Though the bulk of Hemingway's text is factually correct, it is also colored by his disappointment in Fitzgerald, as well as Hemingway's own rivalrous response towards any competitor, living or dead. That disappointment was most evident in The Green Hills of Africa, where he specifically mentions Fitzgerald as an archetypal ruined American writer; Hemingway had been both shocked and unnerved by Fitzgerald's account of his own difficulties in his nonfiction essays and notebooks from the 1930s, published as The Crack-Up (with Edmund Wilson as editor) in 1945. Fitzgerald’s friendship with Hemingway was quite vigorous and as many of Fitzgerald’s relationships would prove to be. (As, indeed, were many of the thrice-divorced Hemingway's.) Hemingway did not get on well with Zelda, either. He claimed that she “encouraged her husband to drink so as to distract Scott from his ‘real’ work on his novel,"" the other work being the short stories he sold to magazines. This “whoring”, as Fitzgerald, and subsequently Hemingway, called these sales, was a sore point in the authors’ friendship. Fitzgerald claimed that he would first write his stories in an authentic manner but then put in “twists that made them into saleable magazine stories.” "" Wikipedia."

The author does a great job in providing cutting edge entertainment, weaving it all in a tall tale and at the same time making the farcical plausible. The fun, the play on words, the punastic delights run wild and the story hops on down the bloody, fishy, and stinky bunny trail. Well done and well worth your time to read this book.” ~The Shadow . “This book was a fun, fast paced read and almost as strange as the original AIW, in a good way. The climactic scenes in the courtroom were fascinating. The many threads of the story pulled together at the end came together smoothly and I really enjoyed it. I loved watching the courtroom scenes play out. Ohhh… the dirty little secrets all coming to light and taking out the bad guys one by one... great!” ~ Red Adept Reviews. “I love this story as much for the comedy as I do for the perfect characterization. These characters are just as mad and scary as the original Lewis Carroll characters. The humor is clean and perfectly in context with the characters delivering it, for example, Nigel Channing's British humor is very John Cleese and Kit the Drag Queen's take down of one of the corrupt lawyers is hilarious, a perfect ‘Priscilla, Queen of the Desert’ moment. This is a highly polished story and the author’s writing style is very easy to read and enjoy, which makes this the perfect book to curl up with on a rainy afternoon."" ~ Mandy Ward, Author. Silkstone’s writing has been described as “perfectly paced and pitched - shades of Janet Evanovich and Carl Hiaasen without seeming remotely derivative. Fast moving action that shoots from the hip with bullet-proof characterization.”"

Beam Piper (Twelve Terro-Human Future History Novels in One Volume)","NOTE: This edition has a linked ""Table of Contents"" and has been beautifully formatted (searchable and interlinked) to work on your Amazon e-book reader, Amazon Desktop Reader, and your ipod e-book reader.. The Terro-Human Future History is Piper's detailed account of the next 6000 years of human history. 1942, the year the first fission reactor was constructed, is defined as the year 1 A.E. (Atomic Era). In 1973, a nuclear war devastates the planet, eventually laying the groundwork for the emergence of a Terran Federation, once humanity goes into space and develops antigravity technology.. It's important to note that many of these stories work fine as stand-alone books and you don't necessarily have to read them in order.. The story ""The Edge of the Knife"" (Book One) occurs slightly before the war, and involves a man who sees flashes of the future. It links many key elements of Piper's series.. Most of the stories take place during the next millennium, during the age of the two Federations. Most notable among these novels Little Fuzzy, which concerns the recognition of a peculiar alien species as sapient, and the efforts of the two species to learn to live together on the Fuzzies' home adopted world of Zarathustra.. The Federation collapses in the System States War and following Interstellar Wars (a bit of which can be seen in Book Eight: The Cosmic Computer), leading to a lengthy time of instability, during which there is no central human power. Space Viking is set in this chaotic period.. Piper's future history resemble in some ways Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, and was probably influenced by it.. This volume includes two of the most loved science fiction stories ever written:. Little Fuzzy--The story revolves around determining whether a small furry species discovered on the planet Zarathustra is sapient. Along the way a gentle kind of libertarianism that emphasizes sincerity and honesty is advocated. But things are not as simple or as nice as they appear to be.... Space Viking--One day, a starship rediscovered the Old Federation. Civilization had collapsed, presumably due to the war; many of the planets had regressed to varying stages of semi-barbarism. Taking advantage of the situation, space vikings proceeded to raid the poorly defended Federation worlds over the next three hundred years for loot.. In the face of this isolation and the political instability, Lucas Trask, seeks to avenge his wife's murderer and discover his true destiny.... In this volume:. Book One: The Edge of the KnifeBook Two: OmnilingualBook Three: Four-Day PlanetBook Four: Uller UprisingBook Five: NaudsonceBook Six: Little FuzzyBook Seven: Oomphel in the SkyBook Eight: The Cosmic ComputerBook Nine: Space VikingBook Ten: A Slave is a SlaveBook Eleven: Ministry of DisturbanceBook Twelve: The Keeper.

Hamilton’s Anita Blake books would enjoy this series with paranormal activity as well as romance.” - Library Journal Once upon a time if you told doctors you heard voices, they’d diagnose you as schizophrenic, put you on heavy drugs, and lock you away in a cozy state institution to keep you from hurting yourself or others. Nowadays they test you first to see if you’re psychic. Victor Bayne, the psychic half of a PsyCop team, is a gay medium who’s more concerned with flying under the radar than making waves. He hooks up with handsome Jacob Marks, a non-psychic (or “Stiff”) from an adjacent precinct at his ex-partner’s retirement party, and it seems like his dubious luck has taken a turn for the better. But then a serial killer surfaces…and no one can agree what he looks like. Solving murders is a snap when you can ask the victims whodunit, but this killer’s not leaving any spirits behind.

A summary from the book's Preface:I have no apology to make, and no excuse to offer for writing this book, ""Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days'. It is not the result of vanity, neither is it a desire for notoriety, that prompted me to write it. No, my reasons are higher, and my purposes are nobler. My only desire has been to do good. The religious element runs through the entire story. . It has been a work of faith and a labor of love to me. I cannot express the pleasure I have had in sitting down, and recalling the incidents of my childhood and youth. In doing so, it has enabled me to live my life over again. I only hope that the reader will experience something of the same pleasure in reading the book that I have had in writing it. . The ""Brief Sketches of the Author"" were written just twenty years ago by the late Rev. J. Wofford White. He was a colored man, and a close friend of mine, and was born and reared in the same neighborhood with myself. These sketches were printed in The Christian Witness, a Boston newspaper, and were clipped and carefully pasted in my scrapbook. I republish them in this connection without changing a single word. I would ask the reader to peruse them carefully, and compare them with Chapter XI, entitled ""Little Jimmie, the Mail Boy,"" and note the similarity of characters. . I have written this book because there is no other work in existence just like it. No author, white or colored, so far as I know, has traversed, or attempted to traverse, the literary path which I presume to have trodden in writing this book. We are now about forty-five years away from the last days of slavery and the first days of freedom, and the people who have any personal knowledge of those days are rapidly crossing the mystic river, and entering the land that knows no shadows; and soon, there will not be one left to tell the story. And it is the author's thought that a record of the better life of those days should be left for the good of the future generations of this beautiful southland. Others have written of the evil side of those days, but the author felt it to be his mission to write of the better side. . Before the war, the relation that existed between the master and his slaves was, in most cases, one of tenderness and affection. There was a mutual attachment between them, which has commanded the admiration of the world. But since the war, an estrangement between the colored and the white races has sprung up, which has resulted in a feeling of intense bitterness and alienation. But I am glad to say that things are now taking a turn for the better. I can see signs of a better day ahead ; and if this book should, in any way, contribute to, and help on this much desired day, the author will be satisfied. . Chapters:Brief Sketches of the Author I.

No joke. But don’t get the wrong idea; I’m not a backwoods hillbilly, even though I do come from a long line of rednecks and hicks. There is a big difference between a hillbilly and a redneck, you know. Oh, and just to set the record straight right from the start; contrary to popular belief (i.e., the movie Sweet Home Alabama ) we don't eat bologna cake here - that's sick! I'd never even heard of it before that movie! We prefer cheeseburger pie or a fried Twinkie and, most importantly, chocolate gravy! Although that does remind me of the story my Momma told me about how my Uncle Jeremiah, when he was little, snuck some bologna into church, stood on the front pew and......OK, I'm chasing a rabbit now, as my grandpa likes to say. Back to the subject, which is me. One thing you need to know – I am going to be a big country music star one day. I know this because my great-grandma Patty Lou said so when I was just a little girl and all the family knows that her visions are surprisingly accurate. Also because I have become an overnight news sensation. You are probably wondering how a young redneck nobody could have all the news channels begging for an interview and that is what I will let you in on a little later. Oh yeah, my name. Most people wonder about my name. I was named Memphis cause that’s where I was born. And my middle name is Autumn cause I was born in late October. Momma and Daddy had gone to Memphis to look at a car and decided that they wanted to visit Graceland too. Momma’s water broke, two weeks early, right there on The King’s property. Of course that was back in the days when Momma and Daddy were still young and in love and married. They divorced last year and me, Momma and my little sister Maddie, aka – The Rat, had moved in with my grandparents ‘for a short spell’ that was turning into a long spell it seemed. So much has happened in my life in such a short time. The past couple of months could have provided material for a hundred episodes of some bizarre reality show. A redneck version of The Osbornes or Hogan Knows Best – only we are poor and nobody, except maybe Uncle Elroy and Aunt Mirtle, knows anything about wrestling…. There have been wonderful, magical moments - and some absolutely awful and painful ones. Dark secrets have been uncovered, lies have been told, hearts have been broken and miracles have occurred. I’ve done a lot of growing up. Some of the stuff that’s happened, well, you just flat won’t believe. Like how I became known as The Chocolate Gravy Queen and why I consider it to be such an honor – and how I was almost murdered. Anyway, I won’t bore you with all the details of my life since my birth, which my Momma assures me was long and painful on that October day in Memphis, so I’ll just back-track about a month to when the story starts getting real interesting and when I got my first real taste of the stage…"

Or, trying to host Thanksgiving in China where holiday staples like turkey and dinner rolls are almost impossible to find. Not every Thanksgiving in America is a folk-art painting. They are as varied as Americans themselves, and run the spectrum of emotion and experience - from as rural as watching Grandma slaughter the holiday bird by the barn, to the traditional with family football games in the yard, and to the modern with multicultural meals complete with eggrolls. . It is a holiday for everyone - regardless of whether arrival to the United States was via the Mayflower, Ellis Island, international airport, or any other way. It is a holiday steeped in traditions (which are either faithfully followed, radically ignored, or adapted to individual circumstances), memories and images. . In Thanksgiving Tales: True Stories of the Holiday in America, 48 writers from across the United States share their individual stories and memories of Thanksgiving and provide insight into the variety of ways the holiday is experienced, celebrated, viewed and cherished by Americans. But, whether held in a country farmhouse, amid the frantic pace of New York City, or in a restaurant, there are a number of common elements. These stories reveal how seemingly simple things- like the passing of a tradition to the next generation, sitting next to Grandpa, favorite foods and recipes, or certain sounds, sights, and smells - can have special meaning and leave warm and indelible memories. . Some of the stories describe the chaos and mishaps of meal preparation, family arguments and first-time hosts - all crises then, but now looked upon with laughter. Other stories recount family traditions, meaningful moments, memorable guests and hosts, remembering those no longer with us, being alone or out-and-out hating the holiday. Thanksgiving Tales is a reflection of Americans, as much as it is a look at the holiday. . It is a testament to the importance of the holiday that Americans will go to great lengths for Thanksgiving - spending money to travel long distances or taking days to prepare meals, sometimes only to find themselves seated next to the weird cousin or sick all night from bacteria-laden food. Yet, it's done all over again the next year."

[Siren Menage Amour: Erotic Western Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M] Epitome of pure evil, born without a heart, soul, or conscience...even his parents did not claim him.An outlaw who takes what he wants...The moment Devin Spawn stumbles upon the exquisite beauty bathing alone in a river, he wants her. Morality non-existent, yet he struggles to keep his distance. His sexual excesses and massive proportions would be too much for the tiny girl who appears more waifish and innocent than womanly.A widow with so much to give...The instant Megan Spawn feels his heated touch and potent sensuality, her flesh burns with wanton desires. It matters little he is the devilishly handsome outlaw known as the Devil's Spawn, the most feared, lethal gunslinger in the West -- and her stepson.Together they risk everything in the devil's playground...Where sexuality is as untamed as the bloodthirsty savages roaming the western frontier, and childhood sweetheart Caleb Walker is guilty as sin, the dark side of lust and passionate surrender comes at a hefty price when the three forge a Devil's Pact. REVIEW for Devil's Pact""Devin Spawn is an outlaw. Given away at birth by his father, Devin travels to his father's ranch to find out why. When he gets close, he comes across a tiny, beautiful woman bathing in the river. Since he has the devil inside of him, Devin does the one thing that comes natural to him--he seduces and makes her his own. There is one thing Devin doesn't know. He has just had relations with his stepmother. Megan Spawn has had a tough life. Rescued from a life of drudgery by her now deceased husband, she wants to spend her life caring for her stepdaughters and possibly being able to have a relationship with the town doctor, her first love, Caleb Walker. That is, until she is touched by the outlaw known as Devil's Spawn. Caleb Walker has loved Megan ever since she was a little girl. When his family caught them in the barn when they were teenagers and sent him away, Caleb has despaired of ever being able to be with Megan. He loves her and is willing to give her time. However, with the arrival of Devin Spawn, time may be running out because it seems that no matter how much Caleb loves her, she might not be his for the taking. Megan and Devin enter into a carnal relationship like none before. Their coming together is sensual and passionate. It is harsh and bold. But where does Caleb fit into this equation? Caleb and Devin enter into a pact, a pact where Caleb becomes part of the pair to make a triad. While Devil's Pact wasn't the tender and enchanting menage that I have grown used to reading, it still engrossed me cover to cover, and with the book being over 180,000 words, that is saying quite a lot. In all honesty, I didn't put it down. Samantha Cruise has written a menage unlike any I have read and I plan to read anything else she releases. She caught my attention with Devil's Pact and I think she will hold it for a long time."" --Talia Ricci, Joyfully Reviewed"

Synopsis:. A dark force is born from the uncommon imaginations of young Sean and Cole Golden, casting a cold shadow over Nod, the ever-changing land of dreams. When the malevolent entity abducts the Sandman, and then snatches its own creators from their cozy beds in an Iowa farmhouse, Jake (the boys’ cynical father) is forced to resurrect the imaginative child within in order to cross the adult-proof barrier that separates the real from the surreal. In Nod, a world literally made of our dreams, the younger Jake must rescue Sean, Cole, and the Sandman before the sleep-deprived citizens of the world burn everything to the ground. . Jake faces physical manifestations of all manner of dreams, including a treacherous money forest, Lost Lake (where mankind’s collected regrets churn beneath black waters), They and Them (monochromatic Siamese twins who are the architects of The Rules for accountants and elementary school teachers), The Tree of Hope, and Death himself—who turns out to be a pretty nice guy. But despite the wondrous locales and characters contained in the story, there is a current of authentic emotion tethering the whimsical fantasy elements to a credible reality like the string of a bright red balloon tied around a child's wrist.. SLEEPWALKER: THE LAST SANDMAN is a modern fantasy without wizards, faeries, dragons, or vampires. It is an exploration of the origin of dreams and the tale of a world-weary, brokenhearted father’s love for the sons he has neglected far too long. It is a fantastical journey through lost love and rediscovered hope that may lead to redemption—for one family, and the world entire..

It was the primary Bible of the 16th century Protestant movement and was the Bible used by William Shakespeare, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, John Knox, John Donne, and John Bunyan, author of Pilgrim's Progress. It was one of the Bibles taken to America on the Mayflower, it was used by many English Dissenters, and it was still respected by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers at the time of the English Civil War.What makes this version of the Holy Bible significant is that, for the very first time, a mechanically printed, mass-produced Bible was made available directly to the general public which came with a variety of scriptural study guides and aids (collectively called an apparatus), which included verse citations which allow the reader to cross-reference one verse with numerous relevant verses in the rest of the Bible, introductions to each book of the Bible which acted to summarize all of the material that each book would cover, maps, tables, woodcut illustrations, indexes, as well as other included features — all of which would eventually lead to the reputation of the Geneva Bible as history's very first study bible.Because the language of the Geneva Bible was more forceful and vigorous, most readers preferred this version strongly over the Bishops' Bible, the translation authorized by the Church of England under Elizabeth I. In the words of Cleland Boyd McAfee, ""it drove the Great Bible off the field by sheer power of excellence"".The two other most significant editions of the Geneva Bible are the 1587 Tomson New Testament edition and the use of the notes of Franciscus Junius on Revelation from 1599 on. Also of note are the Geneva Bible editions of 1568-1570, which contain Calvin’s Catechism, and later editions which included Calvinistic doctrine as catechism.Lawrence Tomson brought out a New Testament in 1576, based on Beza’s Greek and Latin New Testaments, and using Beza’s Latin New Testament notes. Tomson’s New Testament, including the margin notes, replaced the Geneva 1560 New Testament in a 1587 quarto edition of the Geneva Bible. While there were some changes in the biblical text, the major difference in the Tomson New Testament was in the margin notes. Some readers continued to prefer the Geneva Bible 1560 New Testament version. This resulted in some Geneva Bibles having the 1560 New Testament and notes and others having Tomson’s New Testament and notes, from 1587 on. 1587 Geneva Bible with marginal notes, formatted for the Kindle E-Book reader."

Later that night, when a wicked storm blows in from the north, Phil and his family are forced to shack up with the rest of the campers.

Check out Jeff's other books: The Secret Tree (NEW), Creepy (The Full Collection), Twisted Vengeance, and Reunion! . In the summer of 2010, I took my family on a camping trip. We set up camp, started a fire, roasted hot dogs, and began what was supposed to be a great weekend. We knew there was a 30% chance of thunder showers but went anyway. Well, guess what? Within the first 3-4 hours of our weekend excursion, the sky turned black as night, the wind picked up and a huge wall of clouds came rushing at the campground like nothing I've ever seen before. The camp owner buzzed through the campground on a golf cart, urging all of us to come to the store basement before the storm hit. We did. . If you've ever been camping, you'll know that there are a varity of characters in a campground. With all of us packed like sardines, pets and all, the writer in me began to imagine what it would be like if we were trapped in there. What if we couldn't get out? What if a tree fell on the building and it caught on fire? What if one of the campers was a killer? Sounds crazy I know. But that's how my writerly mind works; I can't apologize for that. . While huddled up with my family, I started characterizing the other detainees and we had a few laughs. Before long, the rain dried up and we were set free. When we returned, I wrote The Rumblin'. I hope you enjoy it. It's short, but fast paced, filled with a great cast, and very suspenseful. . REVIEWS:""Reading the reviews of this book, I wondered if it was all it was hyped up to be.

Worse, some of the local citizens suspect Miranda of using magic, a treasonous offense, because of the unusual cat that has followed her on her quest.

A collection of five thrilling Joe Muller books written by acclaimed mystery writer, Augusta Groner. . Detective Joe Muller observes human behaviour closely and absorbs atmosphere to draw his conclusions but is also capable of using disguise and subterfuge.. Joseph Muller, Secret Service detective of the Imperial Austrian police, is one of the great experts in his profession. In personality he differs greatly from other famous detectives. He has neither the impressive authority of Sherlock Holmes, nor the keen brilliancy of Monsieur Lecoq.. Muller is a small, slight, plain-looking man, of indefinite age, and of much humbleness of mien. A naturally retiring, modest disposition, and two external causes are the reasons for Muller’s humbleness of manner, which is his chief characteristic. One cause is the fact that in early youth a miscarriage of justice gave him several years in prison, an experience which cast a stigma on his name and which made it impossible for him, for many years after, to obtain honest employment.. But the world is richer, and safer, by Muller’s early misfortune.... Included in this volume:Book 1: The Case of the Lamp That Went OutBook 2: The Case of the Registered LetterBook 3: The Case of the Pocket Diary Found In the SnowBook 4: The Case of the Pool of Blood in the Pastor’s StudyBook 5: The Case of the Golden Bullet.

Celia is a beautiful and innocent young woman who is seduced by Robert, a handsome and knowledgeable man.

This fascinating tale allows the reader to escape into a world of sultans, harems, and a beautiful love slave with her English lord. Even though Celia and Robert’s story is so much different from the other beautiful women in Celia’s predicament, I found my heart going out to those women who couldn’t be helped and had to suffer their fate when they were sold into slavery. Emma Wildes blends some wonderful characters, romance, and a bit of history to make a sensual read that keeps the readers interest. She paints characters with so much emotion that touch the reader, especially the poor women in bondage, yet she creates a very poignant love story between Celia and Robert that is remarkably breathtaking making this one excellent read."" —Linda L., Fallen Angel Reviews"

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Stuart Wynne, CEO of Wynne enterprises, raised his commanding baritone voice. “All right Fallon, you made your point. Are you ready to come back to me?”. She’d accompanied Michelle to the study part of Stuart’s opulent thirtieth floor penthouse. Where Michelle had gone, she had no idea. She studied Stuart, tall with deep blue eyes, and short dark hair with a touch of gray. She’d gone with him for two years when she was principal show girl, and really loved him…or his money, she couldn’t be sure. Regrettably, at the time, he belonged to someone else. Now, though she was tempted, she couldn’t—she had married Dana. He’d warned her that Dana was a loser, but she’d been in heat. He was so gorgeous, like a movie star. “I can’t. You know I’m married.”. Stuart rolled his eyes and sneered. “Humph! To a dealer, what’s he make? A hundred grand?”. At Stuart’s sarcastic inquiry, her vision wandered past Stuart to the bright lights of the ‘Las Vegas Strip.’ “Eighty,” she replied casually.. As she took a seat, he repeated her answer, “Eighty?” and laughed derisively. “I make a thousand times that. See, he’s not even a good dealer. Is he any good in bed?”. Her gaze shifted back to Stuart. He’d gone too far and her nostrils flared in annoyance. “Yes, the best sex I’ve ever had.”. He raised a single skeptical eyebrow and cupped his chin with his left hand. “Really, at least he’s good at something. Maybe, I underestimated him. How am I?” Stuart asked boldly.. She wanted to hurt him. She wanted to say the worst, but she couldn’t do it. “The second best.”. “Out of how many?” he asked with a mischievous tone in his voice.She uncrossed her legs and sat up, knees and legs together. With her eyes narrowed and chin stuck out, she admonished him. “A gentleman would never ask that of a lady.”. The expectant look of his face changed to a frown. “Sorry.”. “Apology accepted.”. Stuart’s blue eyes narrowed. The corners of his lips curled up. “Then, my dear, if your husband is the best lover you’ve ever had and I’m the second best, you haven’t lived until you’ve had us both…simultaneously.”. Initially, she was shocked by his audacity. Then, as the idea sunk in, a tiny ember of yearning ignited in her core. Wouldn’t that be an interesting scenario? “Well,” she said in a huff, “that certainly isn’t going to happen.”. A grin of confidence formed on his face. “Don’t be so sure, sweetheart. Tell me, if your husband agreed, would you go for it?”. The ember grew and burst into a flame. She crossed her legs and pulled her skirt, which had risen, down. “If he insisted, I would go along.."

Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul..

I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

Stuart Wynne, CEO of Wynne enterprises, raised his commanding baritone voice. “All right Fallon, you made your point. Are you ready to come back to me?”. She’d accompanied Michelle to the study part of Stuart’s opulent thirtieth floor penthouse. Where Michelle had gone, she had no idea. She studied Stuart, tall with deep blue eyes, and short dark hair with a touch of gray. She’d gone with him for two years when she was principal show girl, and really loved him…or his money, she couldn’t be sure. Regrettably, at the time, he belonged to someone else. Now, though she was tempted, she couldn’t—she had married Dana. He’d warned her that Dana was a loser, but she’d been in heat. He was so gorgeous, like a movie star. “I can’t. You know I’m married.”. Stuart rolled his eyes and sneered. “Humph! To a dealer, what’s he make? A hundred grand?”. At Stuart’s sarcastic inquiry, her vision wandered past Stuart to the bright lights of the ‘Las Vegas Strip.’ “Eighty,” she replied casually.. As she took a seat, he repeated her answer, “Eighty?” and laughed derisively. “I make a thousand times that. See, he’s not even a good dealer. Is he any good in bed?”. Her gaze shifted back to Stuart. He’d gone too far and her nostrils flared in annoyance. “Yes, the best sex I’ve ever had.”. He raised a single skeptical eyebrow and cupped his chin with his left hand. “Really, at least he’s good at something. Maybe, I underestimated him. How am I?” Stuart asked boldly.. She wanted to hurt him. She wanted to say the worst, but she couldn’t do it. “The second best.”. “Out of how many?” he asked with a mischievous tone in his voice.She uncrossed her legs and sat up, knees and legs together. With her eyes narrowed and chin stuck out, she admonished him. “A gentleman would never ask that of a lady.”. The expectant look of his face changed to a frown. “Sorry.”. “Apology accepted.”. Stuart’s blue eyes narrowed. The corners of his lips curled up. “Then, my dear, if your husband is the best lover you’ve ever had and I’m the second best, you haven’t lived until you’ve had us both…simultaneously.”. Initially, she was shocked by his audacity. Then, as the idea sunk in, a tiny ember of yearning ignited in her core. Wouldn’t that be an interesting scenario? “Well,” she said in a huff, “that certainly isn’t going to happen.”. A grin of confidence formed on his face. “Don’t be so sure, sweetheart. Tell me, if your husband agreed, would you go for it?”. The ember grew and burst into a flame. She crossed her legs and pulled her skirt, which had risen, down. “If he insisted, I would go along.."

"914CCB92247743B1B0D12DC5CD49D909",,true,"The House of Dr. Edwardes (RosettaBooks Into Film)","From the outset, the air that Beeding's characters breathe crackles with ominous electricity. This is surely what appealed to Alfred Hitchcock when he found Beeding's The House of Dr. Edwardes and used it as the inspiration for his unforgettable film Spellbound.. The """"house"""" of the title is a lunatic asylum in France and Dr. Edwardes is the head psychiatrist. While Edwardes is held in high esteem, an almost iconic figure in psychiatric circles, there is something clearly amiss. The novel opens with a puzzling, ominous episode in which a patient being transported to the asylum grows agitated as the car bringing him there approaches. The patiently suddenly screams: """"the gorge of the devil"""" and then attacks and kills one of the supervisors, a promising but inexperienced psychiatrist. This opens a position that Dr. Sedgwick accepts, but on arrival, she learns that Dr. Edwardes has taken a leave of absence to calm his nerves. It doesn't take her long to discover that the house is hardly in order.. The House of Dr. Edwardes and Hitchcock's Spellbound are both about madness, power, and terror. What is most interesting is the two very different approaches taken by each to illustrate these ideas. For Spellbound, Hitchcock borrowed heavily from Freudian psychoanalysis and its emphasis on dreams. Salvatore Dali's surrealistic interpolations are used to illustrate the more irrational aspects of the story. Beeding owes less to Freud, displaying much closer affinities with the brooding, psychological landscapes of Gothic novels of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights. The result is a compelling work--part mystery, part modern Gothic.. ABOUT THE AUTHOR. Francis Beeding is a pseudonym used by two British writers--Hilary St. George Saunders (1898-51) and John Palmer (1885-44), best friends who co-authored dozens of novels throughout the 1920s, '30s and '40s. The two authors actually had two pen-names; one was Francis Beeding who penned crime novels, and the other David Pilgrim, who wrote historical novels. Saunders in particular wrote prolifically, also partnering with Geoffrey Dennis to write under the pseudonym Barum Browne, and teamed with a member of parliament, John de Vere Loder, to write under the moniker Cornelius Coffyn.. Francis Beeding wrote over thirty novels, five of which have been adapted into feature films. Of these, his 1927 work The House of Dr. Edwardes remains the best known, forming the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Spellbound. During the Second World War, Saunders and Palmer wrote cloak-and-dagger stories involving British efforts to combat the Nazis.. SERIES DESCRIPTIONS. From classic book to classic film, RosettaBooks has gathered some of most memorable books into film available. The selection is broad ranging and far reaching, with books from classic genre to cult classic to science fiction and horror and a blend of the two creating whole new genres like Richard Matheson's The Shrinking Man. Classic works from Vonnegut, one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, meet with E.M. Forrester's A Passage to India. Whether the work is centered in the here and now, in the past, or in some distant and almost unimaginable future, each work is lasting and memorable and award-winning."""

Alma, the fifth of nine children, was born in 1910 in lower Davidson County, North Carolina—as she says, ""fifteen miles south of Lexington, off number 8 Highway, between Newsom and High Rock, near Jackson Hill and Bald Mountain, in the backwoods of nowhere."" Alma lived with her mama and daddy, who were poor sharecroppers, in a small shack-like house on the edge of the large Reid farm that lay between Cabin Creek and Lick Creek on the Yadkin River. In her own words, Alma resurrects now forgotten times and places as she shares with us the everyday trials of life as a sharecroppers in the early 1900s. Through vivid descriptions she leads us through their daily customs folklores and hardships. She speaks of how they had to make do with what they had and how the little that they had was treasured. At age twelve Alma's family left the sharecropping way and moved twenty miles north of the backwoods to Lexington, the county seat. In Lexington her life changed dramatically. First, her one room school was replaced with more modern schools. Then, at a young age she was forced to quit school to help out the family. The biggest change came in her late teens when she met and married Odell Henderson Owen, and in the years that followed, became the mother of eleven children. During the chaotic years of raising eleven children she never forgot her upbringing, how her mama and daddy had instilled in her the importance of family, church and community. Like her daddy, she worked hard, always putting her family's needs first. And in times of personal need, she sought strength through the church .The beauty of this book is in the voice of the book—Alma's voice. Alma tells her story with a warmth that leaves you laughing at times and at other times holding a tissue to your eyes."

All of the minor formatting glitches and typos, referenced in some of the early user reviews, have been resolved. This e-book has an active table of contents and has been designed to allow you to jump between chapters with a flick of the Kindle's four-way controller (or ""joystick"" in older Kindles).. * * * * * *. Synopsis:. A dark force is born from the uncommon imaginations of young Sean and Cole Golden, casting a cold shadow over Nod, the ever-changing land of dreams. When the malevolent entity abducts the Sandman, and then snatches its own creators from their cozy beds in an Iowa farmhouse, Jake (the boys’ cynical father) is forced to resurrect the imaginative child within in order to cross the adult-proof barrier that separates the real from the surreal. In Nod, a world literally made of our dreams, the younger Jake must rescue Sean, Cole, and the Sandman before the sleep-deprived citizens of the world burn everything to the ground. . Jake faces physical manifestations of all manner of dreams, including a treacherous money forest, Lost Lake (where mankind’s collected regrets churn beneath black waters), They and Them (monochromatic Siamese twins who are the architects of The Rules for accountants and elementary school teachers), The Tree of Hope, and Death himself—who turns out to be a pretty nice guy. But despite the wondrous locales and characters contained in the story, there is a current of authentic emotion tethering the whimsical fantasy elements to a credible reality like the string of a bright red balloon tied around a child's wrist.. SLEEPWALKER: THE LAST SANDMAN is a modern fantasy without wizards, faeries, dragons, or vampires. It is an exploration of the origin of dreams and the tale of a world-weary, brokenhearted father’s love for the sons he has neglected far too long. It is a fantastical journey through lost love and rediscovered hope that may lead to redemption—for one family, and the world entire.. A thematic cousin to PETER PAN and ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND, this unique adventure offers emotional complexity to mature readers while delivering a thrilling ride for the young and the young at heart.. * * * * * *.

Andrew Ashton grows up in a world very similar to ours, but where slavery has been reintroduced. While trying to deal with growing up gay and looking for romance, the institution of slavery begins to intrude uncomfortably in his life. Andrew is a spoiled, little rich kid. So are his friends. He's not a bad person. He's just a bit conceited. He knows he will one day inherit the family fortune, so who cares about grades, work or whatever. He discovers that people seem to find him reasonably attractive, which only goes to confirm him in his complacency. Little rich kids have their troubles too. He realizes he's gay and that he has a major crush on his best friend Sean Denham, the youngest scion of a political dynasty. In his society slavery is an accepted institution. More, it is regarded as a vital component to keep the economy running smoothly. It is the least of Andrew's concerns, wrapped up as he is in his own romantic troubles. That is, until the institution of slavery becomes more and more a real, even menacing factor..
