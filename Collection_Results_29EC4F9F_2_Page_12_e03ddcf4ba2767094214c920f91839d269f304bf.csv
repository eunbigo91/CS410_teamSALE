Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

[Siren Menage Amour: Erotic Western Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M] Epitome of pure evil, born without a heart, soul, or conscience...even his parents did not claim him.An outlaw who takes what he wants...The moment Devin Spawn stumbles upon the exquisite beauty bathing alone in a river, he wants her. Morality non-existent, yet he struggles to keep his distance. His sexual excesses and massive proportions would be too much for the tiny girl who appears more waifish and innocent than womanly.A widow with so much to give...The instant Megan Spawn feels his heated touch and potent sensuality, her flesh burns with wanton desires. It matters little he is the devilishly handsome outlaw known as the Devil's Spawn, the most feared, lethal gunslinger in the West -- and her stepson.Together they risk everything in the devil's playground...Where sexuality is as untamed as the bloodthirsty savages roaming the western frontier, and childhood sweetheart Caleb Walker is guilty as sin, the dark side of lust and passionate surrender comes at a hefty price when the three forge a Devil's Pact. REVIEW for Devil's Pact""Devin Spawn is an outlaw. Given away at birth by his father, Devin travels to his father's ranch to find out why. When he gets close, he comes across a tiny, beautiful woman bathing in the river. Since he has the devil inside of him, Devin does the one thing that comes natural to him--he seduces and makes her his own. There is one thing Devin doesn't know. He has just had relations with his stepmother. Megan Spawn has had a tough life. Rescued from a life of drudgery by her now deceased husband, she wants to spend her life caring for her stepdaughters and possibly being able to have a relationship with the town doctor, her first love, Caleb Walker. That is, until she is touched by the outlaw known as Devil's Spawn. Caleb Walker has loved Megan ever since she was a little girl. When his family caught them in the barn when they were teenagers and sent him away, Caleb has despaired of ever being able to be with Megan. He loves her and is willing to give her time. However, with the arrival of Devin Spawn, time may be running out because it seems that no matter how much Caleb loves her, she might not be his for the taking. Megan and Devin enter into a carnal relationship like none before. Their coming together is sensual and passionate. It is harsh and bold. But where does Caleb fit into this equation? Caleb and Devin enter into a pact, a pact where Caleb becomes part of the pair to make a triad. While Devil's Pact wasn't the tender and enchanting menage that I have grown used to reading, it still engrossed me cover to cover, and with the book being over 180,000 words, that is saying quite a lot. In all honesty, I didn't put it down. Samantha Cruise has written a menage unlike any I have read and I plan to read anything else she releases. She caught my attention with Devil's Pact and I think she will hold it for a long time."" --Talia Ricci, Joyfully Reviewed"

They want her in their bed, their lives, now…forever… She is everything they wanted, needed—but she has to want both of them. Together, separately, in any and every combination they can think of. As the sexual heat between them escalates, all three are forced to make decisions having far-reaching ramifications. Sometimes choosing love is the hardest decision of all."

"40BD6E7AA4A245188611997C49510264",,true,"Life in a Tank","TANKS!To the uninitiated--as were we in those days when we returned to the Somme, too late to see the tanks make their first dramatic entrance--the name conjures up a picture of an iron monster, breathing fire and exhaling bullets and shells, hurling itself against the enemy, unassailable by man and impervious to the most deadly engines of war; sublime, indeed, in its expression of indomitable power and resolution.This picture was one of the two factors which attracted us toward the Heavy Branch Machine-Gun Corps--as the Tank Corps was known in the first year of its being. On the Somme we had seen a derelict tank, wrecked, despoiled of her guns, and forsaken in No Man's Land. We had swarmed around and over her, wild with curiosity, much as the Lilliputians must have swarmed around the prostrate Gulliver. Our imagination was fired.The second factor was, frankly, that we were tired of going over the top as infantrymen. The first time that a man goes into an attack, he as a rule enjoys it. He has no conception of its horrors,--no, not horrors, for war possesses no horrors,--but, rather, he has no knowledge of the sudden realization of the sweetness of life that comes to a man when he is ""up against it."" The first time, it is a splendid, ennobling novelty. And as for the ""show"" itself, in actual practice it is more like a dream which only clarifies several days later, after it is all over. But to do the same thing a second and third and fourth time, is to bring a man face to face with Death in its fullest and most realistic uncertainty. In soldier jargon he ""gets most awful wind up."" It is five minutes before ""Zero Hour."" All preparations are complete. You are waiting for the signal to hop over the parapet. Very probably the Boche knows that you are coming, and is already skimming the sandbags with his machine guns and knocking little pieces of earth and stone into your face. Extraordinary, how maddening is the sting of these harmless little pebbles and bits of dirt! The bullets ricochet away with a peculiar singing hiss, or crack overhead when they go too high. The shells which burst on the other side of the parapet shake the ground with a dull thud and crash. There are two minutes to wait before going over. Then is the time when a man feels a sinking sensation in his stomach; when his hands tremble ever so slightly, and when he offers up a pathetic little prayer to God that if he's a bit of a sportsman he may be spared from death, should his getting through not violate the divine and fatalistic plans. He has that unpleasant lack of knowledge of what comes beyond. For after all, with the most intense belief in the world, it is hard to reconcile the comforting feeling of what one knows with that terrible dread of the unknown.A man has no great and glorious ideas that nothing matters because he is ready to die for his country. He is, of course, ready to die for her. But he does not think about it. He lights a cigarette and tries to be nonchalant, for he knows that his men are watching him, and it is his duty to keep up a front for their sake. Probably, at the same time, they are keeping up a front for him. Then the Sergeant Major comes along, cool and smiling, as if he were out for a stroll at home. Suddenly he is an immense comfort. One forgets that sinking feeling in the stomach and thinks, ""How easy and jolly he is! What a splendid fellow!"" Immediately, one begins unconsciously to imitate him. Then another thinks the same thing about one, and begins to imitate too. So it passes on, down the line. But there is nothing heroic or exalting in going over the top.This, then, was our possible second reason for preferring to attack inside bullet-proof steel; not that death is less likely in a tank, but there seems to be a more sporting chance with a shell than with a bullet."

What I especially liked about the PI is his repartee style of interrogation. He’s the kind of guy who has the best comebacks that anyone could possibly have... unlike most of us that cannot think of a great rejoinder until some time after the conversation is over. Knighthorse has them all right at the tip of this tongue. His wit is enormous and dead on point all the time. Suffice it to say, this was one heck of a ride from page one to page last.” ―Amazon reviewer★★★★★ “As an avid thriller reader and reviewer, I pride myself on being on the cutting edge of new releases. How I could have missed J.R. Rain and his Jim Knighthorse is a mystery to me. (Pardon the pun.) Knighthorse is a reluctant private detective and aspiring pro-football player. He is big, strong, kind and cold and deadly. I know that sounds like a conflict of terms, but Rain makes it work, and work beautifully. Well written with believable dialog and plot-line. It was an enjoyable and nail-biting read. I plan on making J.R. Rain and his Jim Knighthorse series a staple in my Kindle library. I happily give this book a 5-star rating, and recommend it anyone looking for a new hero.” ―Amazon reviewer★★★★★ “It’s not easy being a PI, especially when police think they have a slam-dunk murderer in custody. A wise-guy with a great sense of moral direction in a California setting. Plenty of twists right to the end and well worth the time.” ―Amazon reviewerClick BUY NOW or READ FOR FREE to begin the Jim Knighthorse series of detective thrillers today!"

Alma, the fifth of nine children, was born in 1910 in lower Davidson County, North Carolina—as she says, ""fifteen miles south of Lexington, off number 8 Highway, between Newsom and High Rock, near Jackson Hill and Bald Mountain, in the backwoods of nowhere."" Alma lived with her mama and daddy, who were poor sharecroppers, in a small shack-like house on the edge of the large Reid farm that lay between Cabin Creek and Lick Creek on the Yadkin River. In her own words, Alma resurrects now forgotten times and places as she shares with us the everyday trials of life as a sharecroppers in the early 1900s. Through vivid descriptions she leads us through their daily customs folklores and hardships. She speaks of how they had to make do with what they had and how the little that they had was treasured. At age twelve Alma's family left the sharecropping way and moved twenty miles north of the backwoods to Lexington, the county seat. In Lexington her life changed dramatically. First, her one room school was replaced with more modern schools. Then, at a young age she was forced to quit school to help out the family. The biggest change came in her late teens when she met and married Odell Henderson Owen, and in the years that followed, became the mother of eleven children. During the chaotic years of raising eleven children she never forgot her upbringing, how her mama and daddy had instilled in her the importance of family, church and community. Like her daddy, she worked hard, always putting her family's needs first. And in times of personal need, she sought strength through the church .The beauty of this book is in the voice of the book—Alma's voice. Alma tells her story with a warmth that leaves you laughing at times and at other times holding a tissue to your eyes."

'The Thinking Machine Mysteries' is a comprehensive collection of forty-four stories featuring author Jacques Futrelle's most famous detective, Professor Van Dusen--the 'Thinking Machine,' who solved impossible crimes.. Professor Augustus Van Dusen, the 'Thinking Machine,' is an eccentric scientist with superior mental powers. He has an assistant, the clever newspaper reporter Hutchinson Hatch, who brings him cases. This model of team work was copied later by many mystery writers, among them Rex Stout in his books about Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe. With Sherlock Holmes, Van Dusen shared an unemotional and technical approach to problems, but without Holmes' human weaknesses, such as drug-taking, or Father Brown's moral and political concerns.. Van Dusen exemplified pure thought without human feelings. In 'The Problem of a Dressing Room,' there's an explanation of how the professor got his nickname: Van Dusen recounts how he can't play chess but that after a few hours of instruction he could defeat a master player. When Van Dusen proves that he wasn't joking, and beats his Russian opponent, the man exclaims: ""Mon Dieu! You are not a man; you are a brain - a machine - a thinking machine."". In 1912 Jacques Futrelle was returning with his wife to New York on the Titanic in first class. After the ship had collided with the iceberg, she was escorted by her husband to lifeboat 9, filled almost to capacity. When Mrs Futrelle hesitated, an officer forced her into the boat, and she survived the disaster. Jacques Futrelle and several of his stories, which he had written during his stay in England, went down with the ship.. Included in this volume:- The Haunted Bell- The Problem of Cell 13 (The Thinking Machine's most celebrated case!)- The Phantom Motor- A Piece of String- The Problem of the Auto Cab- Problem of the Broken Bracelet- The Chase of the Golden Plate (Full-length novel)- Problem of Convict No. 97- Problem of the Cross Mark- Problem of the Crystal Gazer- Problem of the Deserted House- Problem of a Dressing Room- The First Problem- Mystery of the Fatal Cipher- Five Millions by Wireless- Mystery of the Flaming Phantom- Problem of the Ghost Woman- Mystery of the Golden Dagger- The Great Auto Mystery- Problem of the Green Eyed Monster- The Grinning God- Mystery of the Grip of Death- Problem of the Hidden Million- Problem of the Interrupted Wireless- The Jackdaw- Kidnapped Baby Blake, Millionaire- Problem of the Knotted Cord- The Tragedy of the Life Raft- Problem of the Lost Radium- Mystery of the Man Who Was Lost- Problem of the Missing Necklace- Problem of the Motor Boat- My First Experience With the Great Logician- Problem of the Opera Box- Problem of the Organ Grinder- Problem of the Perfect Alibi- Problem of the Private Compartment- Mystery of the Ralston Bank Burglary- Problem of the Red Rose- The Roswell Tiara- Mystery of the Scarlet Thread- The Case of the Scientific Murderer- The Silver Box- Problem of the Souvenir Cards- Problem of the Stolen Bank Notes- The Three Overcoats- Problem of the Vanishing Man- Problem of he Stolen Rubens- The Mystery of a Studio- Problem of the Superfluous Finger.

I had to keep a fan on as I read through the pages."" -- Layken, Wild on Books. [Siren Menage Amour: Erotic Western Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M] Epitome of pure evil, born without a heart, soul, or conscience...even his parents did not claim him.An outlaw who takes what he wants...The moment Devin Spawn stumbles upon the exquisite beauty bathing alone in a river, he wants her. Morality non-existent, yet he struggles to keep his distance. His sexual excesses and massive proportions would be too much for the tiny girl who appears more waifish and innocent than womanly.A widow with so much to give...The instant Megan Spawn feels his heated touch and potent sensuality, her flesh burns with wanton desires. It matters little he is the devilishly handsome outlaw known as the Devil's Spawn, the most feared, lethal gunslinger in the West -- and her stepson.Together they risk everything in the devil's playground...Where sexuality is as untamed as the bloodthirsty savages roaming the western frontier, and childhood sweetheart Caleb Walker is guilty as sin, the dark side of lust and passionate surrender comes at a hefty price when the three forge a Devil's Pact. REVIEW for Devil's Pact""Devin Spawn is an outlaw. Given away at birth by his father, Devin travels to his father's ranch to find out why. When he gets close, he comes across a tiny, beautiful woman bathing in the river. Since he has the devil inside of him, Devin does the one thing that comes natural to him--he seduces and makes her his own. There is one thing Devin doesn't know. He has just had relations with his stepmother. Megan Spawn has had a tough life. Rescued from a life of drudgery by her now deceased husband, she wants to spend her life caring for her stepdaughters and possibly being able to have a relationship with the town doctor, her first love, Caleb Walker. That is, until she is touched by the outlaw known as Devil's Spawn. Caleb Walker has loved Megan ever since she was a little girl. When his family caught them in the barn when they were teenagers and sent him away, Caleb has despaired of ever being able to be with Megan. He loves her and is willing to give her time. However, with the arrival of Devin Spawn, time may be running out because it seems that no matter how much Caleb loves her, she might not be his for the taking. Megan and Devin enter into a carnal relationship like none before. Their coming together is sensual and passionate. It is harsh and bold. But where does Caleb fit into this equation? Caleb and Devin enter into a pact, a pact where Caleb becomes part of the pair to make a triad. While Devil's Pact wasn't the tender and enchanting menage that I have grown used to reading, it still engrossed me cover to cover, and with the book being over 180,000 words, that is saying quite a lot. In all honesty, I didn't put it down. Samantha Cruise has written a menage unlike any I have read and I plan to read anything else she releases. She caught my attention with Devil's Pact and I think she will hold it for a long time."" --Talia Ricci, Joyfully Reviewed"

The fantastic tales that the townsfolk tell about the Ac-Taw, a clan of people who can shift into animals, are nothing but folklore. Or are they? Burke is stunned by his response to Rachel, and even more so when she innocently shows signs of possessing Ac-Taw blood. And this puts her in more danger than she knows, danger that only increases the urgency to mark her as his own. Rachel comes to realize she's inherited much more than just property. She has also inherited a destiny to protect her newfound home. For the Ac-Taw aren't just legend-they're real."

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Oddly the epicenters seem to be located at every major military installation around the world.

""This blending of two major Victorian characters is written in a style so seamless you can almost believe it was found in the attic of one of Doyle’s editors. Yes, it’s a little darker than I usually read, but I honestly couldn’t put it down. The nuances of Holmes, Watson, and yes, Count Vlad Dracula himself are layered and well-drawn. You’ll hold your breath, I promise. It’s quite simply the most believable Holmes/fantasy crossover I’ve ever read."" - from STEAMED! @ http://ageofsteam.wordpress.com. ""What's most remarkable about this story is the degree of authenticity Klaver gives it-- it reads just like a story by Doyle (or Watson, if you prefer!). The attention to Victorian detail is also noteworthy, and it's clear that the author knows his Holmes mythology. You may think you've seen all that can be done with teh sub-genre of ""Holmes meets Dracula"" tales, but The Case of the Solitary Grave is exciting and refreshingly unpredictable. As a bonus, we get a very touching look at the deep bond of friendship between Holmes and Watson."" - Heath Lowrance. ""I was very pleased with this short story. I am a big fan of the original Sherlock Holmes stories and of the novel Dracula. This short story was well written and was strikingly similar to the style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the original tales."" - JVib. The Supernatural Case-Files of Sherlock Holmes.

The implications of that remarkable convention would be felt around the world and indeed are still being felt today.. In Seneca Falls and the Origins of the Woman's Rights Movement, the latest contribution to Oxford's acclaimed Pivotal Moments in American History series, Sally McMillen unpacks, for the first time, the full significance of that revolutionary convention and the enormous changes it produced. The book covers 50 years of women's activism, from 1840-1890, focusing on four extraordinary figures--Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, and Susan B. Anthony. McMillen tells the stories of their lives, how they came to take up the cause of women's rights, the astonishing advances they made during their lifetimes, and the lasting and transformative effects of the work they did. At the convention they asserted full equality with men, argued for greater legal rights, greater professional and education opportunities, and the right to vote--ideas considered wildly radical at the time. Indeed, looking back at the convention two years later, Anthony called it ""the grandest and greatest reform of all time--and destined to be thus regarded by the future historian."" In this lively and warmly written study, Sally McMillen may well be the future historian Anthony was hoping to find.. A vibrant portrait of a major turning point in American women's history, and in human history, this book is essential reading for anyone wishing to fully understand the origins of the woman's rights movement."

On the Somme we had seen a derelict tank, wrecked, despoiled of her guns, and forsaken in No Man's Land. We had swarmed around and over her, wild with curiosity, much as the Lilliputians must have swarmed around the prostrate Gulliver. Our imagination was fired.The second factor was, frankly, that we were tired of going over the top as infantrymen. The first time that a man goes into an attack, he as a rule enjoys it. He has no conception of its horrors,--no, not horrors, for war possesses no horrors,--but, rather, he has no knowledge of the sudden realization of the sweetness of life that comes to a man when he is ""up against it."" The first time, it is a splendid, ennobling novelty. And as for the ""show"" itself, in actual practice it is more like a dream which only clarifies several days later, after it is all over. But to do the same thing a second and third and fourth time, is to bring a man face to face with Death in its fullest and most realistic uncertainty. In soldier jargon he ""gets most awful wind up."" It is five minutes before ""Zero Hour."" All preparations are complete. You are waiting for the signal to hop over the parapet. Very probably the Boche knows that you are coming, and is already skimming the sandbags with his machine guns and knocking little pieces of earth and stone into your face. Extraordinary, how maddening is the sting of these harmless little pebbles and bits of dirt! The bullets ricochet away with a peculiar singing hiss, or crack overhead when they go too high. The shells which burst on the other side of the parapet shake the ground with a dull thud and crash. There are two minutes to wait before going over. Then is the time when a man feels a sinking sensation in his stomach; when his hands tremble ever so slightly, and when he offers up a pathetic little prayer to God that if he's a bit of a sportsman he may be spared from death, should his getting through not violate the divine and fatalistic plans. He has that unpleasant lack of knowledge of what comes beyond. For after all, with the most intense belief in the world, it is hard to reconcile the comforting feeling of what one knows with that terrible dread of the unknown.A man has no great and glorious ideas that nothing matters because he is ready to die for his country. He is, of course, ready to die for her. But he does not think about it. He lights a cigarette and tries to be nonchalant, for he knows that his men are watching him, and it is his duty to keep up a front for their sake. Probably, at the same time, they are keeping up a front for him. Then the Sergeant Major comes along, cool and smiling, as if he were out for a stroll at home. Suddenly he is an immense comfort. One forgets that sinking feeling in the stomach and thinks, ""How easy and jolly he is! What a splendid fellow!"" Immediately, one begins unconsciously to imitate him. Then another thinks the same thing about one, and begins to imitate too. So it passes on, down the line. But there is nothing heroic or exalting in going over the top.This, then, was our possible second reason for preferring to attack inside bullet-proof steel; not that death is less likely in a tank, but there seems to be a more sporting chance with a shell than with a bullet."

When he opened the door, I could see that he appreciated the view by the bulge in his pants.. “Where to now, my dear? How about a moonlit stroll?” he asked.. Leaning my seat back, I muttered, “Surprise me.”. Wow, I was so wet. All through dinner I kept imagining what effect I had on him. I felt like I was on display as he slid his hand up my thigh. Between the alcohol and his touch, I was ready for just about anything... at least that is what I thought.. “Why don’t we go shopping for a new toy?” I couldn’t believe it slipped out of my mouth.. We walked into an adult bookstore that I had never seen before. I felt like all eyes in the place were focused on me. I was, I guess, the only woman in the place. I watched several men walk through a curtain covered doorway near the back.. “What is that?” I asked my husband.. “Booths. Place to watch videos,” he answered.. I tugged on his shirt sleeve to indicate that I wanted to see. So, my husband grabbed my hand and walked me through the curtain. I actually felt a little more comfortable the moment I realized that we were in a long, dark hallway. I had almost felt like I was the main attraction as almost everyone in the store seemed to be staring at me.. We walked down past several booths until we found one empty. We slipped inside and made ourselves as comfortable as possible. My husband put a 5 dollar bill in and selected a movie. I sat on the bench staring at his ***. As he turned around, I instinctively reached for his ****. He grabbed my wrist and pushed it away. “Not yet.”.

Oh, and just to set the record straight right from the start; contrary to popular belief (i.e., the movie Sweet Home Alabama ) we don't eat bologna cake here - that's sick! I'd never even heard of it before that movie! We prefer cheeseburger pie or a fried Twinkie and, most importantly, chocolate gravy!

Of course that was back in the days when Momma and Daddy were still young and in love and married. They divorced last year and me, Momma and my little sister Maddie, aka – The Rat, had moved in with my grandparents ‘for a short spell’ that was turning into a long spell it seemed. So much has happened in my life in such a short time. The past couple of months could have provided material for a hundred episodes of some bizarre reality show.

"1B508BB865A946038E2FAEF04FF32EF6",,true,"Butterflies Are Free To Fly: A New and Radical Approach to Spiritual Evolution","When Nicolaus Copernicus discovered the Earth wasn’t the center of the Universe, everything changed. When Isaac Newton figured out the law of gravity from a falling apple, everything changed. When Benjamin Franklin harvested electricity from lightening and Thomas Edison made the first commercial light bulb, everything changed. Today, when quantum physicists realize our physical universe isn’t real, that it’s just a hologram, everything … wait! Nothing’s changed - yet. ""Butterflies Are Free To Fly"" offers a new and radical approach to spiritual evolution based on the recent scientific experiments in quantum physics and brain research outlined in Part One. Given that the physical universe which looks and feels so real to us is actually a unique holographic projection from our own brain, the author examines various models for life and living that are very different than what we have been told and taught. “This is the only radical thinking that you need to do,” Dr. Amit Goswami is quoted as saying. “But it is so radical, it is so difficult, because our tendency is that the world is already ‘out there,’ independent of my experience. It is not. Quantum Physics has been so clear about it.” For example, in Part Two we are introduced to something the author calls an “Infinite I,” which is creating our unique holographic experiences. Then there is the “Human Game Model,” offering explanations all the way from why we experience pain and suffering to how we can change our reactions and responses by letting go of our judgments, beliefs, opinions, and fears. The end result, suggests the author, is peeling away all the layers of false identities that make up the “ego,” transforming and emerging from our cocoon as a “no-self.” Part Three of the book is a series of questions and answers to offer alternative explanations consistent with these models on subjects such as money, past lives, karma, trust, and the “Earth Environment.”This book will leave you thinking, because this book is truly radical."

But second chances aren’t easy for Freeman, the victim of painful childhood experiments that gave him the ability to read other people’s minds.. Little does Freeman know that his transfer was made at the request of Dr. Richard Kracowski, whose research into the brain’s electrical properties is revealing new powers of the human mind. Kracowski is working for a secret society called the Trust, but also has his own agenda in exploring the nature of the soul. His experiments have an unexpected side effect, though.

When he meets the anorexic Vicky, who may also be telepathic, he’s afraid some of his darkest secrets will be uncovered. But when the other children develop their own clairvoyant abilities, and insane spirits begin haunting the halls of Wendover, he can’t safely hide inside his own head anymore..

All of the minor formatting glitches and typos, referenced in some of the early user reviews, have been resolved. This e-book has an active table of contents and has been designed to allow you to jump between chapters with a flick of the Kindle's four-way controller (or ""joystick"" in older Kindles).. * * * * * *. Synopsis:. A dark force is born from the uncommon imaginations of young Sean and Cole Golden, casting a cold shadow over Nod, the ever-changing land of dreams. When the malevolent entity abducts the Sandman, and then snatches its own creators from their cozy beds in an Iowa farmhouse, Jake (the boys’ cynical father) is forced to resurrect the imaginative child within in order to cross the adult-proof barrier that separates the real from the surreal. In Nod, a world literally made of our dreams, the younger Jake must rescue Sean, Cole, and the Sandman before the sleep-deprived citizens of the world burn everything to the ground. . Jake faces physical manifestations of all manner of dreams, including a treacherous money forest, Lost Lake (where mankind’s collected regrets churn beneath black waters), They and Them (monochromatic Siamese twins who are the architects of The Rules for accountants and elementary school teachers), The Tree of Hope, and Death himself—who turns out to be a pretty nice guy. But despite the wondrous locales and characters contained in the story, there is a current of authentic emotion tethering the whimsical fantasy elements to a credible reality like the string of a bright red balloon tied around a child's wrist.. SLEEPWALKER: THE LAST SANDMAN is a modern fantasy without wizards, faeries, dragons, or vampires. It is an exploration of the origin of dreams and the tale of a world-weary, brokenhearted father’s love for the sons he has neglected far too long. It is a fantastical journey through lost love and rediscovered hope that may lead to redemption—for one family, and the world entire.. A thematic cousin to PETER PAN and ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND, this unique adventure offers emotional complexity to mature readers while delivering a thrilling ride for the young and the young at heart.. * * * * * *.

Now, in one eBook, Bantam Classics presents all fifty-six short stories and four novels featuring Conan Doyle’s classic hero—a truly complete collection of Sherlock Holmes’s adventures in crime! Volume I includes the early novel A Study in Scarlet, which introduced the eccentric genius of Sherlock Holmes to the world. This baffling murder mystery, with the cryptic word Rache written in blood, first brought Holmes together with Dr. John Watson. Next, The Sign of Four presents Holmes’s famous “seven percent solution” and the strange puzzle of Mary Morstan in the quintessential locked-room mystery. Also included are Holmes’s feats of extraordinary deception in such famous cases as the chilling “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” the baffling riddle of “The Musgrave Ritual,” and the ingeniously plotted “The Five Orange Pips.” Volume II begins with The Hound of Baskervilles, a haunting novel of murder on eerie Grimpen Moor, which has rightly earned its reputation as the finest murder mystery ever written. The Valley of Fear matches Holmes against his archenemy, the master of imaginative crime, Professor Moriarty. In addition, the loyal Dr. Watson has faithfully recorded Holmes’s feats of extraordinary detection in such famous cases as the thrilling “The Adventure of the Red Circle,” Holmes’s tragic and fortunately premature farewell in “The Final Problem,” and the twelve baffling adventures from The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. Conan Doyle’s incomparable tales bring to life a Victorian England of horse-drawn cabs, fogs, and the famous lodgings at 221 B Baker Street, where for more than forty years Sherlock Holmes earned his undisputed reputation as the greatest fictional detective of all time."

Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul.. I finally got out of bed about 6:30 a.m. and started getting ready to go to the airport. I did everything I possibly could to keep back the tears. Packing my suitcase was so hard. I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward.

I finally got out of bed about 6:30 a.m. and started getting ready to go to the airport. I did everything I possibly could to keep back the tears. Packing my suitcase was so hard. I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

Penney catalogue distribution center in Atlanta, at the University of South Florida in Tampa, and South Georgia Medical Center in Valdosta until she met the future father of her children and married for the second time.. Her second career (and the one dearest to her heart) was in motherhood. She began writing so that she could bring in an income and still stay at home to rear her children. One son, three daughters, 7 grandchildren (and counting), and a gazillion pets later, she now lives in the ‘castle’ she designed and (partly) built herself (the woodworking, anyway) with her boyfriend, Benjamin, a native, Native American—(they have DNA proof!)-- And her two miniature horses, Napoleon and Stormy.

He ended the kiss, but kept her captive in his embrace as he stared into her eyes. The cameras continued to flash and the world swirled crazily. She ran her fingers into the silk of his hair and kissed him again, wanting to chase away the chill Roger had left inside her. Jesse groaned and deepened the kiss more..

Maybe it’s karma, but sparks of frustration turn into the heat of attraction and within the week the pair are involved in an interracial romance with plenty of explicit sex. . But just when things start really heating up, cruel fate steps in at Christmas vacation, when, after a second snafu, the lovebirds are separated the by an ocean of despair—the Atlantic Ocean. . EXCERPTWhen we got back to our room, Rene headed to one of the baths we would be sharing with three other students, while I simply threw on a nightshirt and hopped in bed. I just lay there and reflected on what Tami said. I'd naively thought I had my future at Juilliard mapped out. Rene would be my roommate and best friend for this year. For the next three years since the dorms were mostly for freshmen, I figured we could share an inexpensive two bedroom, New York flat. I wasn't naive, I knew those seven words, an inexpensive two bedroom, New York flat, created an oxymoron, but I'm an optimist.. In the middle of my contemplation, Rene returned. His hair, now darkened and damp, hung uncombed, but that wasn't what caught my attention. The only thing that kept him from standing naked before me was a white towel wrapped around and tucked in his waist.. He smiled. ""Turn your head, ma chere, while I put my pajamas bottoms on."". I did, but I snuck a peek. My mouth watered as he turned his backside to me and dropped the towel. His broad shoulders and muscular chest veed into a narrow waist and ultra-sexy taut buns and that wasn't all. One at a time, he lifted a foot into each pajama leg, his shoulder muscles rippling, but before he pulled them up into place, every ounce of oxygen in my lungs exhaled and my pussy muscles clenched. From betwixt his muscular legs, the underside of his sex, the tip of his penis and his pinkish mauve scrotum, beckoned to me and I couldn't catch my breath. Finally when I thought I would pass out from oxygen deprivation, I gasped a breath of life.. Rene swung around, concern etched on his beautiful face. ""Are you all right?"". My eyelids rose and I gasped again as blood rushed to my clit and pussy. His long, thick male member dangled from the opening in his pajamas.. He looked down and quickly inserted himself. ""Sorry,"" he uttered, but the damage had been done.. The damage, of course, was to my idyllic concept of how we could be platonic friends and roommates for the next four years. ""Girl, you're going to be the horniest dancer in Juilliard. And what about him? Is he supposed to go without for four years?"" What Tami had been trying to tell me slammed into my mind like a head on collision. Why hadn't this been a problem last night? Because, you idiot, you both fell asleep in your clothes after talking half the night.. He smiled. ""Are you going to sleep?"". ""If I can."". ""Would it bother you if I did some things on my computer?"". Apparently on the way to losing my mind, I blurted out, ""This wouldn't be a problem if you weren't so God damned good looking,"" and rolled over to face the wall.. ""What?"". My head turned back part way. ""Never mind, forget I said that."". The mattress sank behind me and then a tender stroke brushed my arm. ""No, mon amour, what is bothering you?"". I turned back over onto my back and raised up on my elbows. ""I'm sorry, I'm so mixed up right now, it's driving me crazy."". SUB-GENRES INCLUDED Erotic RomanceBWWMRomance and SexBDSM"

We set up camp, started a fire, roasted hot dogs, and began what was supposed to be a great weekend. We knew there was a 30% chance of thunder showers but went anyway. Well, guess what? Within the first 3-4 hours of our weekend excursion, the sky turned black as night, the wind picked up and a huge wall of clouds came rushing at the campground like nothing I've ever seen before. The camp owner buzzed through the campground on a golf cart, urging all of us to come to the store basement before the storm hit. We did. . If you've ever been camping, you'll know that there are a varity of characters in a campground. With all of us packed like sardines, pets and all, the writer in me began to imagine what it would be like if we were trapped in there. What if we couldn't get out? What if a tree fell on the building and it caught on fire? What if one of the campers was a killer? Sounds crazy I know. But that's how my writerly mind works; I can't apologize for that. . While huddled up with my family, I started characterizing the other detainees and we had a few laughs. Before long, the rain dried up and we were set free. When we returned, I wrote The Rumblin'. I hope you enjoy it. It's short, but fast paced, filled with a great cast, and very suspenseful. . REVIEWS:""Reading the reviews of this book, I wondered if it was all it was hyped up to be.

He prayed that Yuichi couldn’t hear it and continued on casually, as if it were nothing. “I’m just taking your lead. You said that anyone would do, so I thought it might as well be me.”. Kanae Hayakawa is pretty, popular, and sought after. What could possibly be wrong with his life? Everything. Though he’s known as the “Cool Beauty” of his college, the rumors couldn’t be farther from the truth! Socially awkward, shy, and a little bit tired of all the attention, Kanae doesn’t know how the entire school came to view him as seductive, easy, and willing to sleep with both men and women. Whispers behind his back, propositions for one-night stands, and fanciful rumors ensure that his life, unlike his supposed sex life, will never be easy. . But there is another boy who has become the talk of the entire college: Yuichi Nagao, notorious womanizer and general jerk. He’s famous too, and like Kanae, it’s for all the wrong reasons. He’s been with more women than he can remember, and it’s earned him a horrible reputation. Now that he’s dated the entire female population of the school and made bitter ex-girlfriends of them all, where is he to look for the occasional bout of casual sex? . As fate would have it, Yuichi and Kanae have become fast friends, and the entire school is talking. What in the world is the Cool Beauty doing with the school jerk? Yuichi and Kanae aren’t talking, not that words are necessary anyway—these boys speak the language of the body, so this rumor might not be false after all! .

As their relationship grows, will they remember to open up and understand one another? Or will words go unspoken in favor of the pursuit of bodily pleasure?"

He goes to Exotics, Inc., and buys a human, the latest fad in the pet-trade. Pani is everything he ever hoped for: smart, mischievous, both looking and acting so much like a real person that Bach can almost forget she's only a pet. At least until her actions begin to go beyond the limits of the subspecies' intelligence scientifically accredited to the human animal. She speaks, she writes. When she draws a picture of Earth's solar system, Bach must face the realization that perhaps humans are more than just small, adorable animals.
