Excerpt: CHAPTER II am about to take the back-trail through the Old West — the West that I knew and loved. All my life it has been a pleasure to show its beauties, its marvels and its possibilities to those who, under my guidance, saw it for the first time.. Now, going back over the ground, looking at it through the eyes of memory, it will be a still greater pleasure to take with me the many readers of this book. And if, in following me through some of the exciting scenes of the old days, meeting some of the brave men who made its stirring history, and listening to my camp-fire tales of the buffalo, the Indian, the stage-coach and the pony-express, their interest in this vast land of my youth, should be awakened, I should feel richly repaid.. The Indian, tamed, educated and inspired with a taste for white collars and moving-pictures, is as numerous as ever, but not so picturesque. On the little tracts of his great inheritance allotted him by civilization he is working out his own manifest destiny.. The buffalo has gone. Gone also is the stagecoach whose progress his pilgrimages often used to interrupt. Gone is the pony express, whose marvelous efficiency could compete with the wind, but not with the harnessed lightning flashed over the telegraph wires. Gone are the very bone-gatherers who laboriously collected the bleaching relics of the great herds that once dotted the prairies.. But the West of the old times, with its strong characters, its stern battles and its tremendous stretches of loneliness, can never be blotted from my mind. Nor can it, I hope, be blotted from the memory of the American people, to whom it has now become a priceless possession.. It has been my privilege to spend my working years on the frontier. I have known and served with commanders like Sherman, Sheridan, Miles, Custer and A.A. Carr — men who would be leaders in any army in any age. I have known and helped to fight with many of the most notable of the Indian warriors.. Frontiersmen good and bad, gunmen as well as inspired prophets of the future, have been my camp companions. Thus, I know the country of which I am about to write as few men now living have known it.. Recently, in the hope of giving permanent form to the history of the Plains, I staged many of the Indian battles for the films. Through the courtesy of the War and Interior Departments I had the help of the soldiers and the Indians.. Now that this work has been done I am again in the saddle and at your service for what I trust will be a pleasant and perhaps instructive journey over the old trails. We shall omit the hazards and the hardships, but often we shall leave the iron roads over which the Pullman rolls and, back in the hills, see the painted Indians winding up the draws, or watch the more savage Mormon Danites swoop down on the wagon-train. In my later years I have brought the West to the East — under a tent. Now I hope to bring the people of the East and of the New West to the Old West, and possibly here and there to supply new material for history. ..."

It's full of the requisite, rough-hewn mountaineers, but these men seem more animal than man.. And one of the rude strangers brings out the animal in her during an embarrassingly orgasmic-and scorching-sexual encounter in an alley. The fantastic tales that the townsfolk tell about the Ac-Taw, a clan of people who can shift into animals, are nothing but folklore. Or are they? Burke is stunned by his response to Rachel, and even more so when she innocently shows signs of possessing Ac-Taw blood. And this puts her in more danger than she knows, danger that only increases the urgency to mark her as his own. Rachel comes to realize she's inherited much more than just property. She has also inherited a destiny to protect her newfound home. For the Ac-Taw aren't just legend-they're real."

However, the desire to not change or transition in life was not a conscious one, but an unconscious one. In other words I consciously desired to create change in my life, but I was subconsciously sabotaging myself via all of my unhealed emotional pain from childhood.. So what happened?. I began to wake up and become self aware. It didn't happen overnight, but I did begin to witness myself in semi conscious or unconscious states; I started to see how I was unconsciously creating my reality.. Let me tell you that it's both liberating and kind of embarrassing. This is because you have amazing 'ah ha' moments of clarity when you suddenly see some of your unconscious patterns mixed with cringing moments of 'ugh' as you realize some of the things that you do and say to people that you really are unaware of.. In the end every bit of self awareness that you glean is self empowering in that it enables you to live harmoniously with the people around you and create the life that you really want.. This book will:1) Help you to utilize a greater percentage of your thinking capacity2) Help you to quit self sabotage3) Stimulate your consciousness to think in new and exciting ways4) Help your business to grow and expand5) Bring people together in large and small groups6) Help you to create a vital and balanced relationship with your wife, husband, partner, or mate7) Help you to unlock your creative freedom and bring your A game to the table in life8) Answer the question, 'What is The Secret?'9) Answer the question, 'What is Spirituality?'10)Answer the question, 'What is The Law of Attraction?'11) Teach you how to meditate12) Teach you how to manifest. Perhaps the most powerful thing about this book is that it will give you 'ah ha' moments when you read through the pages. You may begin to see, through my own personal life examples, how we all parallel each other in different ways. As it turns out many (if not all) of our life lessons are really the same, but just with different people and in different places."

'Visions of Distant Shores' is a collection of stories written by award-winning science-fiction author, Andre Norton. In most of Norton's works, alienated outsiders undertake a journey through which they realize their full potential. Many planets in the books are Earth-like places, where humans can live without special protection, and have extensive flora and fauna which are described in considerable detail and often have substantial bearing on the plot.. On February 20, 2005, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, which had earlier honored her with its Grand Master Award in 1983, announced the creation of the Andre Norton Award, to be given each year for an outstanding work of fantasy or science fiction for the young adult literature market, beginning in 2006. .

Book Three: Star Hunter - Somewhere on the jungle world of Jumala, there was a man in hiding--a man whose mind had been reconditioned with another's brain pattern and for whom there was a fabulous reward. Star Hunter is a thrill-packed account of that other-worldly game of hide-and-seek between a man who did not know all his own powers and an interstellar safari that sought something no man had a right to find.... Book Four: Plague Ship - A fast-moving suspense tale, full of unusual detail and unexpected turns.

Excerpt: CHAPTER II am about to take the back-trail through the Old West — the West that I knew and loved. All my life it has been a pleasure to show its beauties, its marvels and its possibilities to those who, under my guidance, saw it for the first time.. Now, going back over the ground, looking at it through the eyes of memory, it will be a still greater pleasure to take with me the many readers of this book. And if, in following me through some of the exciting scenes of the old days, meeting some of the brave men who made its stirring history, and listening to my camp-fire tales of the buffalo, the Indian, the stage-coach and the pony-express, their interest in this vast land of my youth, should be awakened, I should feel richly repaid.. The Indian, tamed, educated and inspired with a taste for white collars and moving-pictures, is as numerous as ever, but not so picturesque. On the little tracts of his great inheritance allotted him by civilization he is working out his own manifest destiny.. The buffalo has gone. Gone also is the stagecoach whose progress his pilgrimages often used to interrupt. Gone is the pony express, whose marvelous efficiency could compete with the wind, but not with the harnessed lightning flashed over the telegraph wires. Gone are the very bone-gatherers who laboriously collected the bleaching relics of the great herds that once dotted the prairies.. But the West of the old times, with its strong characters, its stern battles and its tremendous stretches of loneliness, can never be blotted from my mind. Nor can it, I hope, be blotted from the memory of the American people, to whom it has now become a priceless possession.. It has been my privilege to spend my working years on the frontier. I have known and served with commanders like Sherman, Sheridan, Miles, Custer and A.A. Carr — men who would be leaders in any army in any age. I have known and helped to fight with many of the most notable of the Indian warriors.. Frontiersmen good and bad, gunmen as well as inspired prophets of the future, have been my camp companions. Thus, I know the country of which I am about to write as few men now living have known it.. Recently, in the hope of giving permanent form to the history of the Plains, I staged many of the Indian battles for the films. Through the courtesy of the War and Interior Departments I had the help of the soldiers and the Indians.. Now that this work has been done I am again in the saddle and at your service for what I trust will be a pleasant and perhaps instructive journey over the old trails. We shall omit the hazards and the hardships, but often we shall leave the iron roads over which the Pullman rolls and, back in the hills, see the painted Indians winding up the draws, or watch the more savage Mormon Danites swoop down on the wagon-train. In my later years I have brought the West to the East — under a tent. Now I hope to bring the people of the East and of the New West to the Old West, and possibly here and there to supply new material for history. ..."

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Unusual customs aside, he finds himself in a terrible dilemma. Not only is she English, but the daughter of a friend. In order to rescue her from captivity, he must use her like a harem girl in every way possible... Lady Celia Davenport has been abducted, sold into slavery, and now finds herself in the bed of an Infidel lord. If she gives him erotic pleasure with subservient eagerness, there is a glimmer of hope in her future. Anxious to escape, she finds that perhaps sexual servitude isn't the prison she once imagined. Besides, every time she gives her lover satisfaction, she receives a rare and valuable pearl as a reward. An English lord and a lovely slave find that circumstance and fate have a hand in granting those rare Arabian Pearls... Genre: Erotic Historical [contains graphic sexual content and adult language]Length: Novella  (25,000 words)5 Kisses: ""The Regency era has never been sexier than what you’ll experience in Arabian Pearl. Emma Wildes’ unique writing style is edgy and erotic. Robert’s tenderness is sweet and sexy while Celia’s acceptance of him and her situation is both moving and emotional. These two sensual characters create enough heat to warm you on the coldest of nights and will have you reaching for ice when things get too hot. I anxiously look forward to the remaining stories in the Brothers of the Absinthe Club series. If they’re anything like Arabian Pearl, I'll need to free up more space on my Keeper shelf!"" —Kerin, Two Lips Reviews5 Hearts: ""WOW!! Arabian Pearl is an amazing story. When Celia realizes the situation, she offers herself to Robert. Ms. Wildes has an incredible storytelling talent and she shows it here. Celia is a beautiful and innocent young woman who is seduced by Robert, a handsome and knowledgeable man. Their sexual encounters are beyond erotic; each night for twelve nights Robert teaches Celia something new. I was trembling in my chair as I read about their exploits. Celia grows in this story from an innocent child to an adult and sexually aware young woman. Robert knows that what he is doing is against all the rules of his society, but he does not want Celia punished and thrown into a far corner of the harem. Although they are not allowed to discuss their lives in England, they manage to get to know each other in whispers. I was simply enthralled by this story and I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys a beautiful, graphic and erotic love story."" —Marcy Arbitman, The Romance Studio5 Angels: ""This reader found Arabian Pearl a most interesting read that not only charms but titillates as well. This fascinating tale allows the reader to escape into a world of sultans, harems, and a beautiful love slave with her English lord. Even though Celia and Robert’s story is so much different from the other beautiful women in Celia’s predicament, I found my heart going out to those women who couldn’t be helped and had to suffer their fate when they were sold into slavery. Emma Wildes blends some wonderful characters, romance, and a bit of history to make a sensual read that keeps the readers interest. She paints characters with so much emotion that touch the reader, especially the poor women in bondage, yet she creates a very poignant love story between Celia and Robert that is remarkably breathtaking making this one excellent read."" —Linda L., Fallen Angel Reviews"

His life seems a cruel joke until he meets beautiful, independent Margaret Farnsworth. Margaret, a promised woman, sees only that strong, capable Roy is just the man to guide her through the badlands in search of her brother. . As eastern-bred Margaret struggles to overcome the hardships of the west, Roy’s pleasuring hands and kisses inevitably tear her between two worlds. A marked man, Roy can never give Margaret the respectability she deserves, yet he turns his back on his western code of honor as he dallies with the betrothed beauty. . Excerpt Copyright 2009. Margaret thrust her hands onto her hips and stiffened her back ramrod straight. “Not that it’s any of your business, but my brother sent a telegram to me, asking for my help. He’s in trouble, and sick!” . Margaret felt fear squeeze her heart, and an urgent burning in the pit of her stomach at the thought of her brother suffering somewhere out on this endless prairie. She was driven to see him safe, and if she had to beat off every scoundrel and outlaw in this territory, including this one, well then by God she’d do it. . “Well, that makes me glad I’m not your brother,” Roy scoffed. . “I’m glad, too! My brother wouldn’t smell like cheap perfume!” she lashed back. Margaret was worldly enough to know that western men, like the wild territory, couldn’t be tamed by the mere presence of grace and civility. . Roy winced visibly as he recalled the range-relief gal, the one who’d run her hands over his chest outside the mercantile that afternoon, marking his shirt with her two-bit whore scent. He awkwardly twisted his hat in his hands.. “Where’s home?” he asked abruptly, so as to change the topic of conversation. . “Philadelphia,” she allowed. “I traveled up the Missouri by steamboat, got off at the fort and,” she waved her small hand, “those snakes offered to guide me the rest of the way . . . have you a name?”. Roy chuckled. “My mama, bless her soul, would tan my bottom for forgetting my manners with a lady.” He yanked off his hat, and affected an exaggerated sweeping bow that propelled his thick dark hair forward to frame the hard angles of his face. . “Roy Easton.”. Margaret softened. “Miss Margaret Victoria Taylor Farnsworth.” She extended her hand and smiled. “And thank you for helping me out . . . out of my predicament.” Roy grinned at the woman who hauled a name long enough to need two mules to carry it. He reached to take her smooth white hand, inhaled her intoxicating rose scent, and, feeling a stirring in his groin, he stifled a silent groan. . It was the kind of trouble he didn’t need, especially not now. As his hard cowboy hand met hers in a gentle clasp, he subconsciously registered the fact that she came from the gussied-up stock known as eastern nobility. Sure as steers stampede, those soft-as-silk hands hadn’t known a day of hard work. His rough ones, by contrast, belonged to a hardworking rancher-turned-ex-lawman.. BOOKS IN THE SERIES.

In 2310, humans persecute psions and hunt them to extinction regardless of guilt. Magnius is one of them: an evolutionary offshoot of mankind known for their psychic abilities and tendency to murder in order to utilize their power. Despite using his telekinesis sparingly, his secret makes it back to his childhood tutor. She murdered his best friend's father in cold blood, giving him every reason to run away before his abilities manifested. Now with the hope he'll join her cause to strike down humanity, she sends an assassin to bring him home. Of course, that doesn’t mean he needs to bring him in one piece.. As a consequence of his double life, Magnius faces divorce, bankruptcy, and death—but not necessarily in that order. In his flight to survive, he meets Amii Martin, a woman who recently lost her memory in a laboratory accident. She implores him for help rescuing the only man with ties to her past after relations with a benevolent alien race take a tragic turn. The last thing Magnius needs is to get mixed up in an ugly war, but in order to escape the clutches of his nefarious mentor and save Amii’s father, he’s willing to risk it or die trying..

A journey across a distant time and familiar land in a haunting tale that captures your imagination and draws you into this untamable world. Beautifully written with well-crafted descriptions of life 200 years after the end of technology. In this universe the powers of the mind have been rediscovered. . This tale takes the reader into a post-apochalyptic, alternate future - and a rare friendship that grows from the bonding of a wolf shape shifter, and a human - a human who has evolved into something more than human, going beyond modern-day man and back to what we all were, what we all needed to be, eons ago, in order to survive... . This is the second novel in the shape shifter series.. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS BOOK . ""BRAVO!!!! I loved this novel. However, now I have that sadness that I always have when I finish a good book. You know, that sense of loss?? The characters are so well developed that you become involved in their quest and can't wait to know what happens next. The landscape is so rich with detail and rather eerie references to the past that it seems like a character as well. I highly recommend this book, but caution that it is not easy to put down."" . ""1. Much of the background during Melder's travels are a reminiscent of a 'western' background. 2. Is it SF or is it F? Who cares, it is good. 3. This is not just another catastrophe novel, but the scenes where Melder encounters the ruined remains of our civilization are nice and spooky."" . ""Melder was an exceptional adventure fantasy novel. It has everything you would expect in either genre. I was hooked from the beginning when the melder saved the wolf, and the entire book was a wonderful journey for me as I followed along with the two on their quest. This marvelous story had suspense, humor and delightful characters. I highly recommend this book."" . ""Melder, is refreshingly different. Oh sure, post-apocolypse books have been written, but this book doesn't focus that much on destruction. Rather, it hands it over in poignant moments and snapshots of regret for a rich farm valley that became a wasteland, and mournful sorrow over a family huddled together in their last moments. Those moments are thankfully brief. This book is about a quest, and hope, and a new way of life springing from the ashes like a newborn phoenix. It's about the joy of discovering new friendships and the growth of one's skills. It's about the comfort of companionship and respect for each other's differences. It has some surprising twists and intriguing mysteries. It has questions. The chapters are short which I find make reading faster and also make it easier to put the bookmark in when I have to, which I've come to regret more and more each time I have to do it. My husband accused me of being anti-social. I wish he was a reader so he'd understand what it is to be so engrossed in a good book that everything around you disappears. Those of you who've read this book know all this already. I've kept my review purposely vague for those who haven't read it yet. I hope that you will read it next. To Kathy, thank you for a vivid, comforting, refreshing read that has added moments of hope and humor to my days."""

As eastern-bred Margaret struggles to overcome the hardships of the west, Roy’s pleasuring hands and kisses inevitably tear her between two worlds. A marked man, Roy can never give Margaret the respectability she deserves, yet he turns his back on his western code of honor as he dallies with the betrothed beauty. . Excerpt Copyright 2009. Margaret thrust her hands onto her hips and stiffened her back ramrod straight. “Not that it’s any of your business, but my brother sent a telegram to me, asking for my help. He’s in trouble, and sick!” . Margaret felt fear squeeze her heart, and an urgent burning in the pit of her stomach at the thought of her brother suffering somewhere out on this endless prairie.

The Terro-Human Future History is Piper's detailed account of the next 6000 years of human history. 1942, the year the first fission reactor was constructed, is defined as the year 1 A.E. (Atomic Era). In 1973, a nuclear war devastates the planet, eventually laying the groundwork for the emergence of a Terran Federation, once humanity goes into space and develops antigravity technology.. It's important to note that many of these stories work fine as stand-alone books and you don't necessarily have to read them in order.. The story ""The Edge of the Knife"" (Book One) occurs slightly before the war, and involves a man who sees flashes of the future. It links many key elements of Piper's series.. Most of the stories take place during the next millennium, during the age of the two Federations. Most notable among these novels Little Fuzzy, which concerns the recognition of a peculiar alien species as sapient, and the efforts of the two species to learn to live together on the Fuzzies' home adopted world of Zarathustra.. The Federation collapses in the System States War and following Interstellar Wars (a bit of which can be seen in Book Eight: The Cosmic Computer), leading to a lengthy time of instability, during which there is no central human power. Space Viking is set in this chaotic period.. Piper's future history resemble in some ways Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, and was probably influenced by it.. This volume includes two of the most loved science fiction stories ever written:. Little Fuzzy--The story revolves around determining whether a small furry species discovered on the planet Zarathustra is sapient. Along the way a gentle kind of libertarianism that emphasizes sincerity and honesty is advocated. But things are not as simple or as nice as they appear to be.... Space Viking--One day, a starship rediscovered the Old Federation. Civilization had collapsed, presumably due to the war; many of the planets had regressed to varying stages of semi-barbarism. Taking advantage of the situation, space vikings proceeded to raid the poorly defended Federation worlds over the next three hundred years for loot.. In the face of this isolation and the political instability, Lucas Trask, seeks to avenge his wife's murderer and discover his true destiny.... In this volume:.

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Well, to say that my life just wasn't going the way I wanted it to would be a vast understatement. I my twenties I accumulated over 20 speeding tickets, was fired from around 15 jobs, and went to jail 3 times. I knew I wanted to be successful and achieve my goals, but I couldn't manage to get my act together. It seemed as if there was some sort of invisible force out to get me that would appear out of nowhere and sabotage my efforts.. As it turns out this invisible force has a name and is what Eckhart Tolle refers to as the 'pain body'.. So what this looked like was me getting ready to make some sort of major transition or change in life and then simultaneously creating a reason not to make that transition or change. However, the desire to not change or transition in life was not a conscious one, but an unconscious one. In other words I consciously desired to create change in my life, but I was subconsciously sabotaging myself via all of my unhealed emotional pain from childhood.. So what happened?. I began to wake up and become self aware. It didn't happen overnight, but I did begin to witness myself in semi conscious or unconscious states; I started to see how I was unconsciously creating my reality.. Let me tell you that it's both liberating and kind of embarrassing. This is because you have amazing 'ah ha' moments of clarity when you suddenly see some of your unconscious patterns mixed with cringing moments of 'ugh' as you realize some of the things that you do and say to people that you really are unaware of.. In the end every bit of self awareness that you glean is self empowering in that it enables you to live harmoniously with the people around you and create the life that you really want.. This book will:1) Help you to utilize a greater percentage of your thinking capacity2) Help you to quit self sabotage3) Stimulate your consciousness to think in new and exciting ways4) Help your business to grow and expand5) Bring people together in large and small groups6) Help you to create a vital and balanced relationship with your wife, husband, partner, or mate7) Help you to unlock your creative freedom and bring your A game to the table in life8) Answer the question, 'What is The Secret?'9) Answer the question, 'What is Spirituality?'10)Answer the question, 'What is The Law of Attraction?'11) Teach you how to meditate12) Teach you how to manifest. Perhaps the most powerful thing about this book is that it will give you 'ah ha' moments when you read through the pages. You may begin to see, through my own personal life examples, how we all parallel each other in different ways. As it turns out many (if not all) of our life lessons are really the same, but just with different people and in different places."

Now an adult, he's a responsible and respected member of the Silver Springs Fire Department. But with all he has achieved, there is one thing he still longs for…Veronica Abbott. The sweet, innocent, rich girl was always been out of his league, but that never stopped her from monopolizing his dreams. Now she's back, and the woman she has become leaves Dean with his jaw touching the floor! After a life of domineering parents and becoming a widow in her mid-twenties, Veronica is finally in control of her future. And a future of excitement, surprise and spice is exactly what she wants. Her new business—a shop of sexual favors and lingerie—is sure to give her some of that, but it’s the prospect of Dean Wolcott that really lights the fire inside her.   Genre: Erotic Contemporary [contains graphic sexual content and adult language] Length: Novel (41,000 words) 5 Stars, 2006 Reviewers' Choice Award Nominee: ""Tonya Ramagos is an author who never fails to tell a great story. Caught Off Guard is most definitely one of those. Dean and Veronica are two characters that harbored a secret crush for each other all of their lives but didn't necessarily know it. I loved that Dean (picture totally hot, buff firefighter) is so in touch with what he wants. He's dreamed of Veronica for years. Even believing that he had no chance, a tiny spark was always there. Veronica is a woman who has finally taken control of her life. She's straightforward in her attraction to Dean and goes after him with a single-mindedness that is enviable. Their initial meeting when she comes back to town knocked my socks off and the blazing hot attraction between these two continues throughout the book. They both have to examine what they want and decide whether they are ready to try to find happiness together. Although their relationship occurs quickly, it flows well in this fast paced tale and only the wrap up felt rushed. If you're looking for a quick, hot read, then grab Caught Off Guard."" —Trang, Ecataromance 5 Angels: ""Caught Off Guard explodes with passion and longing! Dean and Veronica share some pretty serious fantasies of each other, but as they find out, the reality is definitely better than either could ever have imagined. I really liked Veronica. She was very take-charge and upfront about her desire for Dean, while being equally upfront about her hesitations for a deeper relationship. She didn't hide what she was feeling and thus, though she couldn't always give Dean the answers he wanted, at least he knew that there was hope for a stronger relationship to spark.      Tonya Ramagos has been on my author radar for awhile and this book just cements her place on my keeper shelf. Perhaps a simple romance plot-wise, the emotional intensity of these characters marks this story as a winner. I hope Ms. Ramagos has plans to write about the other firefighters of Silver Springs."" —Sarah W., Fallen Angel Reviews5 Cups: ""What is hotter than a fireman love story? How about a mature woman that is ready to embrace her sensual side? This book hooked me from the very first page. This story draws you in with the action and the layers of details. I have to say that I loved reading it and hope you do too."" —Missy, Coffee Time Romance"

A collection of five thrilling Joe Muller books written by acclaimed mystery writer, Augusta Groner. . Detective Joe Muller observes human behaviour closely and absorbs atmosphere to draw his conclusions but is also capable of using disguise and subterfuge.. Joseph Muller, Secret Service detective of the Imperial Austrian police, is one of the great experts in his profession. In personality he differs greatly from other famous detectives. He has neither the impressive authority of Sherlock Holmes, nor the keen brilliancy of Monsieur Lecoq.. Muller is a small, slight, plain-looking man, of indefinite age, and of much humbleness of mien. A naturally retiring, modest disposition, and two external causes are the reasons for Muller’s humbleness of manner, which is his chief characteristic. One cause is the fact that in early youth a miscarriage of justice gave him several years in prison, an experience which cast a stigma on his name and which made it impossible for him, for many years after, to obtain honest employment.. But the world is richer, and safer, by Muller’s early misfortune....

What if he escaped back to England, only to be captured by his brilliant daughter Queen Elizabeth, who must decide what to do with her dangerous father, the rightful King?. THE VIRGIN KING begins seventeen years after King Henry VIII’s secret exile, just as he is preparing to send his bastard son William off to England. Faced with what appears to be their final moments together on a deserted island off the coast of Spain, Henry tells William the truth about his exploits as King. What follows is a lively and entertaining narrative that will also give the reader a feel for the paradoxical world in which they are about to enter. One that, in addition to its many colorful characters and surreal backdrop, is truly brought to life as it is seen through the eyes of William, a completely unadulterated knave whose entire world view was shaped by the vainglorious and half-mad King.-Set in one of the most dazzling and exciting periods of England's royal history, THE VIRGIN KING is a high-flying tale that will entertain the reader with each page. It is in no way an esoteric work. It is an ambitious novel written about two legendary figures, and although it portrays an intimate and scandalous portrait of Elizabeth, it is one that is consistent with historical data and the spirit of the times. -.

Sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole, Don Dennis was a man without hope. Nothing short of a miracle could turn his life around. Of Don Dennis, Charles ""Chuck"" Colson said: ""I first met Don Dennis in Walla Walla prison. . . . He was a tough, hard con who gave his heart to the Lord and has been just as tough ever since--but now as a warrior for Christ. A wonderful example of God's grace: the One who can save a Don Dennis or a Chuck Colson can save anyone."". A portion of this book, in somewhat different form, was originally published by Broadman Press in 1993 under the title Breaking Crime's Vicious Cycle.. Excerpt from the book From the Cell to the Cross:. In 1977 Don Dennis stood at attention before a judge in a Seattle, Washington, courtroom.. ""Mr. Dennis,"" the judge began, ""you have been in and out of prison for more than twenty years. After reviewing your history of felonies, escapes, forgeries, and other crimes against society, I am sentencing you to life in prison.. That was Don Dennis, the habitual criminal. Then, he looked at life this way: ""It was me and my prison buddies at war against the police, guards, society. We were like blood brothers."" Don was more comfortable behind prison walls than in free society. Each time he went back into prison, it was like ""going home."" That's where his friends were; that's where people understood him, or so he thought.. More than twenty years later that Don Dennis was no more. He was a man with a different kind of mission. Rather than tearing down, he was building up by helping prisoners and ex-prisoners find a new way of looking at life.. This is the story of how Don Dennis got from there to here. It is nothing short of a miracle.. About the Authors. For almost twenty years, Don Dennis led a group of volunteers in a prison ministry.

Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul.. I finally got out of bed about 6:30 a.m. and started getting ready to go to the airport. I did everything I possibly could to keep back the tears. Packing my suitcase was so hard. I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

"D933908FE08B4D54B57F3B22AE10D193",,true,"F. Scott Fitzgerald Collection","""Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940) was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are evocative of the Jazz Age, a term he coined himself. He is widely regarded as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered a member of the ""Lost Generation"" of the Twenties. He finished four novels, including The Great Gatsby, with another published posthumously, and wrote dozens of short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with despair and age. The 1920s proved the most influential decade of Fitzgerald's development.The Great Gatsby, considered his masterpiece, was published in 1925. Fitzgerald made several excursions to Europe, notably Paris and the French Riviera, and became friends with many members of the American expatriate community in Paris, notably Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway looked up to Fitzgerald as an experienced professional writer. Hemingway greatly admired The Great Gatsby and wrote in his A Moveable Feast ""If he could write a book as fine as The Great Gatsby I was sure that he could write an even better one"" (153). Hemingway expressed his deep admiration for Fitzgerald, and Fitzgerald's flawed, self-defeating character, when he prefaced his chapters concerning Fitzgerald in A Moveable Feast with: His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred. Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and their construction and he learned to think and could not fly any more because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it had been effortless. (129) Much of what Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast helped to establish the myth of Fitzgerald's dissipation and loss (of ability, social control, and life) and Zelda's hand in that demise. Though the bulk of Hemingway's text is factually correct, it is also colored by his disappointment in Fitzgerald, as well as Hemingway's own rivalrous response towards any competitor, living or dead. That disappointment was most evident in The Green Hills of Africa, where he specifically mentions Fitzgerald as an archetypal ruined American writer; Hemingway had been both shocked and unnerved by Fitzgerald's account of his own difficulties in his nonfiction essays and notebooks from the 1930s, published as The Crack-Up (with Edmund Wilson as editor) in 1945. Fitzgerald’s friendship with Hemingway was quite vigorous and as many of Fitzgerald’s relationships would prove to be. (As, indeed, were many of the thrice-divorced Hemingway's.) Hemingway did not get on well with Zelda, either. He claimed that she “encouraged her husband to drink so as to distract Scott from his ‘real’ work on his novel,"" the other work being the short stories he sold to magazines. This “whoring”, as Fitzgerald, and subsequently Hemingway, called these sales, was a sore point in the authors’ friendship. Fitzgerald claimed that he would first write his stories in an authentic manner but then put in “twists that made them into saleable magazine stories.” "" Wikipedia."

A rogue nation decides to take advantage of the chaos at this time to attack America with nuclear weapons. The American intelligence network learns of the plan and the government decides to launch a first strike at this rogue nation. This information leaks out to other nations and soon the world is poised on the brink of all out nuclear conflagration as the nuclear nations choose sides in the coming conflict. As the militaries of the world go underground in preparation for the attack most of the world is blissfully ignorant of what is about to happen. There are a few exceptions to this. The civilians that are aware make plans to try to survive the attack as well. As the moment for the attack draws near, the disaster plagued planet is beset by earthquakes of unprecedented intensity and numbers. Oddly the epicenters seem to be located at every major military installation around the world.

A cozy comedy thriller in the style of Carl Hiaasen, Janet Evanovich, with touches of Monty Python. The adventure is inspired by the original Alice in Wonderland but with a totally different adult plot. . Miami real estate broker, Alice Harte’s addiction to being right almost does her in when she falls for the wrong White Rabbit. Nigel Channing is an international conman with a gift for crafting Byronesque emails. He sweeps Alice off her feet and down a rabbit hole laden with mugs, thugs, and be-headers as they race one-step ahead of Nigel’s enemies.. Will Alice be able to keep her head when all about her are losing theirs? Are the cards stacked against her or will she find true love? Is there a Joker in the deck?. This adventure takes place in 1997 and is slightly based on true events. Enjoy! . ~~~Praise for The Secret Diary of Alice in Wonderland:“This wacky book is a delight. The author does a great job in providing cutting edge entertainment, weaving it all in a tall tale and at the same time making the farcical plausible. The fun, the play on words, the punastic delights run wild and the story hops on down the bloody, fishy, and stinky bunny trail. Well done and well worth your time to read this book.” ~The Shadow . “This book was a fun, fast paced read and almost as strange as the original AIW, in a good way. The climactic scenes in the courtroom were fascinating. The many threads of the story pulled together at the end came together smoothly and I really enjoyed it. I loved watching the courtroom scenes play out. Ohhh… the dirty little secrets all coming to light and taking out the bad guys one by one... great!” ~ Red Adept Reviews. “I love this story as much for the comedy as I do for the perfect characterization. These characters are just as mad and scary as the original Lewis Carroll characters. The humor is clean and perfectly in context with the characters delivering it, for example, Nigel Channing's British humor is very John Cleese and Kit the Drag Queen's take down of one of the corrupt lawyers is hilarious, a perfect ‘Priscilla, Queen of the Desert’ moment. This is a highly polished story and the author’s writing style is very easy to read and enjoy, which makes this the perfect book to curl up with on a rainy afternoon."" ~ Mandy Ward, Author. Silkstone’s writing has been described as “perfectly paced and pitched - shades of Janet Evanovich and Carl Hiaasen without seeming remotely derivative. Fast moving action that shoots from the hip with bullet-proof characterization.”"

Alma, the fifth of nine children, was born in 1910 in lower Davidson County, North Carolina—as she says, ""fifteen miles south of Lexington, off number 8 Highway, between Newsom and High Rock, near Jackson Hill and Bald Mountain, in the backwoods of nowhere."" Alma lived with her mama and daddy, who were poor sharecroppers, in a small shack-like house on the edge of the large Reid farm that lay between Cabin Creek and Lick Creek on the Yadkin River. In her own words, Alma resurrects now forgotten times and places as she shares with us the everyday trials of life as a sharecroppers in the early 1900s. Through vivid descriptions she leads us through their daily customs folklores and hardships. She speaks of how they had to make do with what they had and how the little that they had was treasured. At age twelve Alma's family left the sharecropping way and moved twenty miles north of the backwoods to Lexington, the county seat. In Lexington her life changed dramatically. First, her one room school was replaced with more modern schools. Then, at a young age she was forced to quit school to help out the family. The biggest change came in her late teens when she met and married Odell Henderson Owen, and in the years that followed, became the mother of eleven children. During the chaotic years of raising eleven children she never forgot her upbringing, how her mama and daddy had instilled in her the importance of family, church and community. Like her daddy, she worked hard, always putting her family's needs first. And in times of personal need, she sought strength through the church .The beauty of this book is in the voice of the book—Alma's voice. Alma tells her story with a warmth that leaves you laughing at times and at other times holding a tissue to your eyes."

London's most beloved detective encounters his most deadly foe, and the results will be unlike any Sherlock Holmes adventure before it!. Some Reviews for 'The Adventure of the Solitary Grave':. ""This blending of two major Victorian characters is written in a style so seamless you can almost believe it was found in the attic of one of Doyle’s editors. Yes, it’s a little darker than I usually read, but I honestly couldn’t put it down. The nuances of Holmes, Watson, and yes, Count Vlad Dracula himself are layered and well-drawn. You’ll hold your breath, I promise. It’s quite simply the most believable Holmes/fantasy crossover I’ve ever read."" - from STEAMED! @ http://ageofsteam.wordpress.com. ""What's most remarkable about this story is the degree of authenticity Klaver gives it-- it reads just like a story by Doyle (or Watson, if you prefer!). The attention to Victorian detail is also noteworthy, and it's clear that the author knows his Holmes mythology. You may think you've seen all that can be done with teh sub-genre of ""Holmes meets Dracula"" tales, but The Case of the Solitary Grave is exciting and refreshingly unpredictable. As a bonus, we get a very touching look at the deep bond of friendship between Holmes and Watson."" - Heath Lowrance. ""I was very pleased with this short story. I am a big fan of the original Sherlock Holmes stories and of the novel Dracula. This short story was well written and was strikingly similar to the style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the original tales."" - JVib. The Supernatural Case-Files of Sherlock Holmes.

Oh, and just to set the record straight right from the start; contrary to popular belief (i.e., the movie Sweet Home Alabama ) we don't eat bologna cake here - that's sick! I'd never even heard of it before that movie! We prefer cheeseburger pie or a fried Twinkie and, most importantly, chocolate gravy! Although that does remind me of the story my Momma told me about how my Uncle Jeremiah, when he was little, snuck some bologna into church, stood on the front pew and......OK, I'm chasing a rabbit now, as my grandpa likes to say. Back to the subject, which is me. One thing you need to know – I am going to be a big country music star one day. I know this because my great-grandma Patty Lou said so when I was just a little girl and all the family knows that her visions are surprisingly accurate. Also because I have become an overnight news sensation. You are probably wondering how a young redneck nobody could have all the news channels begging for an interview and that is what I will let you in on a little later. Oh yeah, my name. Most people wonder about my name. I was named Memphis cause that’s where I was born. And my middle name is Autumn cause I was born in late October. Momma and Daddy had gone to Memphis to look at a car and decided that they wanted to visit Graceland too. Momma’s water broke, two weeks early, right there on The King’s property. Of course that was back in the days when Momma and Daddy were still young and in love and married. They divorced last year and me, Momma and my little sister Maddie, aka – The Rat, had moved in with my grandparents ‘for a short spell’ that was turning into a long spell it seemed. So much has happened in my life in such a short time. The past couple of months could have provided material for a hundred episodes of some bizarre reality show. A redneck version of The Osbornes or Hogan Knows Best – only we are poor and nobody, except maybe Uncle Elroy and Aunt Mirtle, knows anything about wrestling…. There have been wonderful, magical moments - and some absolutely awful and painful ones. Dark secrets have been uncovered, lies have been told, hearts have been broken and miracles have occurred. I’ve done a lot of growing up. Some of the stuff that’s happened, well, you just flat won’t believe.
