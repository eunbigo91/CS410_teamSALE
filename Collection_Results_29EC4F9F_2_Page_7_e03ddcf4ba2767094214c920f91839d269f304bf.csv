He’s come to this hilltop to kill the white farmer in the cabin below for the rape his granddaughter, and there’s not a power in Heaven or on earth that can stop him.Inside the cabin a family sits for their evening meal; John and Mary Piver and their daughter, Elizabeth. Life out here has been hard for them, isolated as they are on this great northern plain. Mary has argued constantly that their only daughter needs more out of life than this meager farm can provide. Later, she continues her argument outside, pleading that Elizabeth, approaching thirteen, has no future here but, as usual, her quarrel falls short on John’s deaf ears just as it has the hundred-odd times before. Frustrated, she turns toward the door, then spots a rider in the distance. “Is that an Indian out there, John?”“Yeah, I think so. Nothin’ to worry about, though,” but she notices a hint of concern hidden inside his voice. Late the next morning John is attacked by Two Bulls, who slams him to the ground with a blow from his lance. Now frightened for their safety and fed up with her husband, and fearing they may have to deal with the real threat of violence by this Indian, Mary hitches the team, collects Elizabeth and heads in to town to fetch the sheriff. Sherriff Parker rides back to the farm with them and continues on to the hilltop to confront Two Bulls. “There’s no trouble here, is there Two Bulls?” he asks. Calmly, the old Indian suggests that the farmer, Piver, is insane, insisting that there had been no attack. “Well, you be careful out here,” Parker urges. He turns his horse and leaves. Later that night John realizes that the old man will certainly kill him if he doesn’t take immediate action. He decides then to take the fight to the old man but Two Bulls has anticipated this and, after all of John’s preparation and hard work, Two Bulls once more strikes him with his lance, knocking him unconscious. He drags John down the hill and throws him into the mud of his own pig pen. The next day, more work in the fields and yet another attack by Two Bulls, but this time the old man’s lance purposely finds its mark and cuts deeply into John’s side. Frightened and concerned, Mary stitches his wounds and watches over her husband as he sleeps, but she is troubled also by not knowing the ‘why’ of these attacks. Deep in the night John awakens. Mary asks him to explain and at first he hesitates, then breaks down and, out of fear and humiliation, and knowing that he needs her support desperately, John tells her about Feather and the rape. Appalled, Mary rocks back. “But what does this old man have to do with that?” she asks. ""Two Bulls is her grandfather,” John replies and Mary knows then and there that her husband is doomed, and that nothing is going to stop Two Bulls from getting the justice and retribution that his granddaughter deserves. Oddly, her decision to leave has been made for her, and she’s grateful for the opportunity. Within minutes after John tumbles back into sleep she and Elizabeth ride away, leaving him alone and wounded inside the cabin, and with Two Bulls biding his time."

"ECFA4ED2C92C44A19A230E396FF72190",,true,"Life in a Tank","TANKS!To the uninitiated--as were we in those days when we returned to the Somme, too late to see the tanks make their first dramatic entrance--the name conjures up a picture of an iron monster, breathing fire and exhaling bullets and shells, hurling itself against the enemy, unassailable by man and impervious to the most deadly engines of war; sublime, indeed, in its expression of indomitable power and resolution.This picture was one of the two factors which attracted us toward the Heavy Branch Machine-Gun Corps--as the Tank Corps was known in the first year of its being. On the Somme we had seen a derelict tank, wrecked, despoiled of her guns, and forsaken in No Man's Land. We had swarmed around and over her, wild with curiosity, much as the Lilliputians must have swarmed around the prostrate Gulliver. Our imagination was fired.The second factor was, frankly, that we were tired of going over the top as infantrymen. The first time that a man goes into an attack, he as a rule enjoys it. He has no conception of its horrors,--no, not horrors, for war possesses no horrors,--but, rather, he has no knowledge of the sudden realization of the sweetness of life that comes to a man when he is ""up against it."" The first time, it is a splendid, ennobling novelty. And as for the ""show"" itself, in actual practice it is more like a dream which only clarifies several days later, after it is all over. But to do the same thing a second and third and fourth time, is to bring a man face to face with Death in its fullest and most realistic uncertainty. In soldier jargon he ""gets most awful wind up."" It is five minutes before ""Zero Hour."" All preparations are complete. You are waiting for the signal to hop over the parapet. Very probably the Boche knows that you are coming, and is already skimming the sandbags with his machine guns and knocking little pieces of earth and stone into your face. Extraordinary, how maddening is the sting of these harmless little pebbles and bits of dirt! The bullets ricochet away with a peculiar singing hiss, or crack overhead when they go too high. The shells which burst on the other side of the parapet shake the ground with a dull thud and crash. There are two minutes to wait before going over. Then is the time when a man feels a sinking sensation in his stomach; when his hands tremble ever so slightly, and when he offers up a pathetic little prayer to God that if he's a bit of a sportsman he may be spared from death, should his getting through not violate the divine and fatalistic plans. He has that unpleasant lack of knowledge of what comes beyond. For after all, with the most intense belief in the world, it is hard to reconcile the comforting feeling of what one knows with that terrible dread of the unknown.A man has no great and glorious ideas that nothing matters because he is ready to die for his country. He is, of course, ready to die for her. But he does not think about it. He lights a cigarette and tries to be nonchalant, for he knows that his men are watching him, and it is his duty to keep up a front for their sake. Probably, at the same time, they are keeping up a front for him. Then the Sergeant Major comes along, cool and smiling, as if he were out for a stroll at home. Suddenly he is an immense comfort. One forgets that sinking feeling in the stomach and thinks, ""How easy and jolly he is! What a splendid fellow!"" Immediately, one begins unconsciously to imitate him. Then another thinks the same thing about one, and begins to imitate too. So it passes on, down the line. But there is nothing heroic or exalting in going over the top.This, then, was our possible second reason for preferring to attack inside bullet-proof steel; not that death is less likely in a tank, but there seems to be a more sporting chance with a shell than with a bullet."

Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul..

I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

Through vivid descriptions she leads us through their daily customs folklores and hardships. She speaks of how they had to make do with what they had and how the little that they had was treasured. At age twelve Alma's family left the sharecropping way and moved twenty miles north of the backwoods to Lexington, the county seat. In Lexington her life changed dramatically. First, her one room school was replaced with more modern schools. Then, at a young age she was forced to quit school to help out the family. The biggest change came in her late teens when she met and married Odell Henderson Owen, and in the years that followed, became the mother of eleven children.

And in times of personal need, she sought strength through the church .The beauty of this book is in the voice of the book—Alma's voice.

But second chances aren’t easy for Freeman, the victim of painful childhood experiments that gave him the ability to read other people’s minds.. Little does Freeman know that his transfer was made at the request of Dr. Richard Kracowski, whose research into the brain’s electrical properties is revealing new powers of the human mind.

The electromagnetic fields used in his experiments are summoning the ghosts of the patients who died at Wendover back when it was a psychiatric ward.. Freeman simply wants to survive, take his medicine for manic depression, and deceive his counselors into believing he is happy. When he meets the anorexic Vicky, who may also be telepathic, he’s afraid some of his darkest secrets will be uncovered. But when the other children develop their own clairvoyant abilities, and insane spirits begin haunting the halls of Wendover, he can’t safely hide inside his own head anymore.. Meanwhile, the Trust is installing sophisticated equipment in the home’s basement, aggressively probing the threshold between life and death. And they’ve brought in another scientist who doesn’t share Dr. Kracowski’s reluctance to push the limits..

"7153705886184D7F8A6D8D6A4CF56E23",,true,"Butterflies Are Free To Fly: A New and Radical Approach to Spiritual Evolution","When Nicolaus Copernicus discovered the Earth wasn’t the center of the Universe, everything changed. When Isaac Newton figured out the law of gravity from a falling apple, everything changed. When Benjamin Franklin harvested electricity from lightening and Thomas Edison made the first commercial light bulb, everything changed. Today, when quantum physicists realize our physical universe isn’t real, that it’s just a hologram, everything … wait! Nothing’s changed - yet. ""Butterflies Are Free To Fly"" offers a new and radical approach to spiritual evolution based on the recent scientific experiments in quantum physics and brain research outlined in Part One. Given that the physical universe which looks and feels so real to us is actually a unique holographic projection from our own brain, the author examines various models for life and living that are very different than what we have been told and taught. “This is the only radical thinking that you need to do,” Dr. Amit Goswami is quoted as saying. “But it is so radical, it is so difficult, because our tendency is that the world is already ‘out there,’ independent of my experience. It is not. Quantum Physics has been so clear about it.” For example, in Part Two we are introduced to something the author calls an “Infinite I,” which is creating our unique holographic experiences. Then there is the “Human Game Model,” offering explanations all the way from why we experience pain and suffering to how we can change our reactions and responses by letting go of our judgments, beliefs, opinions, and fears. The end result, suggests the author, is peeling away all the layers of false identities that make up the “ego,” transforming and emerging from our cocoon as a “no-self.” Part Three of the book is a series of questions and answers to offer alternative explanations consistent with these models on subjects such as money, past lives, karma, trust, and the “Earth Environment.”This book will leave you thinking, because this book is truly radical."

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

""A story that moves quickly, in short chapters of crisp prose, with plenty of plot turns to hold the attention, and characters you can love and others you can hate...

""SLAMMER is the most relentlessly page-turning novel this reviewer has come across in a long, long time, but Guthrie does so much more than just throw visceral action and sharp banter at the reader, teasing and cajoling us with red herrings and subtle foreshadowing, delving deep inside a mind that is quickly unravelling into psychotic madness. At SLAMMER's core is a surprisingly subtle examination of what it means to be good or evil, and how easily that distinction can become blurred. Guthrie creates empathy for all his characters -- there are no faceless monsters here -- and in portraying the prisoners and their guards as two sides of the same human coin, he nails a universal truth about the nature of life and about the way we differentiate good and bad, sanity and madness."" -- The Scotsman. ""This is Guthrie's masterpiece to date, grim and brutal in tone, cunning in design and flawless in the telling. Guthrie keeps the numerous plot turns both exciting and believable. There is a surprise twist in the middle of the novel that stuns the reader and makes the pace even faster ... SLAMMER is not only artful, it's real art."" -- Bookgasm. ""an absolute masterpiece, really should be at the top of everyone's ""must-read"" list"" -- Eurocrime. ""Guthrie's prose is a series of short, sharp shocks, reeking of the visceral brutality of the toughest contemporary noir ... those who enjoy the darker side of the genre are in for some serious thrills."" -- The Guardian.

Matt “Tug” Cutugno has lived a good life, that of a hard working family man. He has earned the right to a happy ending; he wants a pat on the back for a job well done. But just where is his reward? Tug’s wife and children are gone and his dreams of a future are now memories of his past – the war; getting married and raising a family; his days as a working man. His present is filled by winter barbeques of grilled kielbasa for breakfast, grilled chicken for lunch and grilled zucchini and hot dogs for dinner. As he sits on his lawn chair in the snow-covered backyard of the home that he built himself, a menagerie of wonderful people visits this extraordinary everyman who is not searching for himself, but who is seeking the meaning of what he accomplished in this life. And with each visit from his wife, his children, his friends and neighbors, his war time buddies, the story of this brave and unsentimental man unfolds so that the past and present merge into something that can be called the truth of an entire generation of men who fought in World War II.

I was hooked from the beginning when the melder saved the wolf, and the entire book was a wonderful journey for me as I followed along with the two on their quest. This marvelous story had suspense, humor and delightful characters. I highly recommend this book."" . ""Melder, is refreshingly different. Oh sure, post-apocolypse books have been written, but this book doesn't focus that much on destruction. Rather, it hands it over in poignant moments and snapshots of regret for a rich farm valley that became a wasteland, and mournful sorrow over a family huddled together in their last moments. Those moments are thankfully brief. This book is about a quest, and hope, and a new way of life springing from the ashes like a newborn phoenix. It's about the joy of discovering new friendships and the growth of one's skills. It's about the comfort of companionship and respect for each other's differences. It has some surprising twists and intriguing mysteries. It has questions. The chapters are short which I find make reading faster and also make it easier to put the bookmark in when I have to, which I've come to regret more and more each time I have to do it. My husband accused me of being anti-social. I wish he was a reader so he'd understand what it is to be so engrossed in a good book that everything around you disappears. Those of you who've read this book know all this already. I've kept my review purposely vague for those who haven't read it yet. I hope that you will read it next. To Kathy, thank you for a vivid, comforting, refreshing read that has added moments of hope and humor to my days."""

'Visions of Distant Shores' is a collection of stories written by award-winning science-fiction author, Andre Norton. In most of Norton's works, alienated outsiders undertake a journey through which they realize their full potential. Many planets in the books are Earth-like places, where humans can live without special protection, and have extensive flora and fauna which are described in considerable detail and often have substantial bearing on the plot.. On February 20, 2005, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, which had earlier honored her with its Grand Master Award in 1983, announced the creation of the Andre Norton Award, to be given each year for an outstanding work of fantasy or science fiction for the young adult literature market, beginning in 2006. . Nobody today is telling better stories of straight-forward interstellar adventure.. Included in this volume:Book One: Storm Over Warlock - Stranded on the alien world of Warlock, Shann Lantree's expedition camp has been wiped out by the Throgs, beings so alien that humans have yet to communicate with them. Lantree must quickly learn how to survive under harsh conditions while being chased by the Throgs -- and how to distinguish the real from the dreamed when he meets the mysterious Wyverns. A satisfying and mature novel which readers will seize upon if they want to enjoy a good adventure story....

Still, a few rebels escaped in the sleeper ships to found free new colonies -- or perish in the attempt. Those few colonists that reached inhabitable worlds were cut off for centuries, and in that isolation and freedom they developed the mysterious mental powers that ""civilization"" had all but destroyed.... Book Three: Star Hunter - Somewhere on the jungle world of Jumala, there was a man in hiding--a man whose mind had been reconditioned with another's brain pattern and for whom there was a fabulous reward. Star Hunter is a thrill-packed account of that other-worldly game of hide-and-seek between a man who did not know all his own powers and an interstellar safari that sought something no man had a right to find.... Book Four: Plague Ship - A fast-moving suspense tale, full of unusual detail and unexpected turns. Several highlights make the book really shine: the sunset gorp hunt on the reefs of an oily sea; a raid on an asteroid's emergency station; and a landing in the Big Burn, resulting in an encounter with the mutant life-forms that reside there....

All of the minor formatting glitches and typos, referenced in some of the early user reviews, have been resolved. This e-book has an active table of contents and has been designed to allow you to jump between chapters with a flick of the Kindle's four-way controller (or ""joystick"" in older Kindles).. * * * * * *. Synopsis:. A dark force is born from the uncommon imaginations of young Sean and Cole Golden, casting a cold shadow over Nod, the ever-changing land of dreams. When the malevolent entity abducts the Sandman, and then snatches its own creators from their cozy beds in an Iowa farmhouse, Jake (the boys’ cynical father) is forced to resurrect the imaginative child within in order to cross the adult-proof barrier that separates the real from the surreal. In Nod, a world literally made of our dreams, the younger Jake must rescue Sean, Cole, and the Sandman before the sleep-deprived citizens of the world burn everything to the ground. . Jake faces physical manifestations of all manner of dreams, including a treacherous money forest, Lost Lake (where mankind’s collected regrets churn beneath black waters), They and Them (monochromatic Siamese twins who are the architects of The Rules for accountants and elementary school teachers), The Tree of Hope, and Death himself—who turns out to be a pretty nice guy. But despite the wondrous locales and characters contained in the story, there is a current of authentic emotion tethering the whimsical fantasy elements to a credible reality like the string of a bright red balloon tied around a child's wrist.. SLEEPWALKER: THE LAST SANDMAN is a modern fantasy without wizards, faeries, dragons, or vampires. It is an exploration of the origin of dreams and the tale of a world-weary, brokenhearted father’s love for the sons he has neglected far too long. It is a fantastical journey through lost love and rediscovered hope that may lead to redemption—for one family, and the world entire.. A thematic cousin to PETER PAN and ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND, this unique adventure offers emotional complexity to mature readers while delivering a thrilling ride for the young and the young at heart.. * * * * * *. From Red Adept's Kindle Book Review Blog:. 4 1/2 Stars. ""The writing style of Mr. Marlowe had a wonderful flow to it that kept me enthralled throughout. The descriptions were vivid, bringing the dream world to life. Although this is listed as a YA novel, it is just as enjoyable for adults, if not more so.

TROUBLEDWhen twelve-year-old Freeman Mills arrives at Wendover, a group home for troubled children, it’s a chance for a fresh start. But second chances aren’t easy for Freeman, the victim of painful childhood experiments that gave him the ability to read other people’s minds.. Little does Freeman know that his transfer was made at the request of Dr. Richard Kracowski, whose research into the brain’s electrical properties is revealing new powers of the human mind. Kracowski is working for a secret society called the Trust, but also has his own agenda in exploring the nature of the soul. His experiments have an unexpected side effect, though. The electromagnetic fields used in his experiments are summoning the ghosts of the patients who died at Wendover back when it was a psychiatric ward.. Freeman simply wants to survive, take his medicine for manic depression, and deceive his counselors into believing he is happy. When he meets the anorexic Vicky, who may also be telepathic, he’s afraid some of his darkest secrets will be uncovered. But when the other children develop their own clairvoyant abilities, and insane spirits begin haunting the halls of Wendover, he can’t safely hide inside his own head anymore.. Meanwhile, the Trust is installing sophisticated equipment in the home’s basement, aggressively probing the threshold between life and death. And they’ve brought in another scientist who doesn’t share Dr. Kracowski’s reluctance to push the limits.. This scientist is a pioneer in ESP induction, and he performed most of his work on a very special subject: his son, Freeman Mills..

Well, to say that my life just wasn't going the way I wanted it to would be a vast understatement. I my twenties I accumulated over 20 speeding tickets, was fired from around 15 jobs, and went to jail 3 times. I knew I wanted to be successful and achieve my goals, but I couldn't manage to get my act together. It seemed as if there was some sort of invisible force out to get me that would appear out of nowhere and sabotage my efforts.. As it turns out this invisible force has a name and is what Eckhart Tolle refers to as the 'pain body'.. So what this looked like was me getting ready to make some sort of major transition or change in life and then simultaneously creating a reason not to make that transition or change. However, the desire to not change or transition in life was not a conscious one, but an unconscious one. In other words I consciously desired to create change in my life, but I was subconsciously sabotaging myself via all of my unhealed emotional pain from childhood.. So what happened?. I began to wake up and become self aware. It didn't happen overnight, but I did begin to witness myself in semi conscious or unconscious states; I started to see how I was unconsciously creating my reality.. Let me tell you that it's both liberating and kind of embarrassing. This is because you have amazing 'ah ha' moments of clarity when you suddenly see some of your unconscious patterns mixed with cringing moments of 'ugh' as you realize some of the things that you do and say to people that you really are unaware of.. In the end every bit of self awareness that you glean is self empowering in that it enables you to live harmoniously with the people around you and create the life that you really want.. This book will:1) Help you to utilize a greater percentage of your thinking capacity2) Help you to quit self sabotage3) Stimulate your consciousness to think in new and exciting ways4) Help your business to grow and expand5) Bring people together in large and small groups6) Help you to create a vital and balanced relationship with your wife, husband, partner, or mate7) Help you to unlock your creative freedom and bring your A game to the table in life8) Answer the question, 'What is The Secret?'9) Answer the question, 'What is Spirituality?'10)Answer the question, 'What is The Law of Attraction?'11) Teach you how to meditate12) Teach you how to manifest. Perhaps the most powerful thing about this book is that it will give you 'ah ha' moments when you read through the pages. You may begin to see, through my own personal life examples, how we all parallel each other in different ways. As it turns out many (if not all) of our life lessons are really the same, but just with different people and in different places."
