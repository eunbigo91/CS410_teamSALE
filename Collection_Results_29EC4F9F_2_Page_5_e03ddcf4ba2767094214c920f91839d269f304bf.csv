'The Thinking Machine Mysteries' is a comprehensive collection of forty-four stories featuring author Jacques Futrelle's most famous detective, Professor Van Dusen--the 'Thinking Machine,' who solved impossible crimes.. Professor Augustus Van Dusen, the 'Thinking Machine,' is an eccentric scientist with superior mental powers. He has an assistant, the clever newspaper reporter Hutchinson Hatch, who brings him cases. This model of team work was copied later by many mystery writers, among them Rex Stout in his books about Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe. With Sherlock Holmes, Van Dusen shared an unemotional and technical approach to problems, but without Holmes' human weaknesses, such as drug-taking, or Father Brown's moral and political concerns.. Van Dusen exemplified pure thought without human feelings. In 'The Problem of a Dressing Room,' there's an explanation of how the professor got his nickname: Van Dusen recounts how he can't play chess but that after a few hours of instruction he could defeat a master player. When Van Dusen proves that he wasn't joking, and beats his Russian opponent, the man exclaims: ""Mon Dieu! You are not a man; you are a brain - a machine - a thinking machine."". In 1912 Jacques Futrelle was returning with his wife to New York on the Titanic in first class. After the ship had collided with the iceberg, she was escorted by her husband to lifeboat 9, filled almost to capacity. When Mrs Futrelle hesitated, an officer forced her into the boat, and she survived the disaster. Jacques Futrelle and several of his stories, which he had written during his stay in England, went down with the ship..

She is far too busy dodging the bullies at school and seeking out new adventures with her friends to worry about what secrets her dragon mentor might be keeping from her, or that her every move is being watched by something living in the forest surrounding her home.. But the secrets run deep, and as Jahrra fights to earn her place in this extraordinary world, she will begin to unravel the truth of it all: that she isn't as safe as she thought she was, that danger lurks around every corner, and that her role in this unfurling tale is far more significant than she could possibly imagine."

A prosecutor prepares for a homicide trial while being pestered by his domineering mother, a famous lawyer herself. Just what role did she play in the murder? It's a mystery with a punch to the gut at the end.. Two of the author's best-loved characters, Steve Solomon and Victoria Lord, appear in ""Solomon & Lord: To Hell and Back."" The ethically-challenged Steve Solomon and the very proper Victoria Lord are mismatched Miami law partners. Steve says he's going fishing with Manuel Cruz, a sleazy con man.

Excerpt: CHAPTER II am about to take the back-trail through the Old West — the West that I knew and loved. All my life it has been a pleasure to show its beauties, its marvels and its possibilities to those who, under my guidance, saw it for the first time.. Now, going back over the ground, looking at it through the eyes of memory, it will be a still greater pleasure to take with me the many readers of this book. And if, in following me through some of the exciting scenes of the old days, meeting some of the brave men who made its stirring history, and listening to my camp-fire tales of the buffalo, the Indian, the stage-coach and the pony-express, their interest in this vast land of my youth, should be awakened, I should feel richly repaid.. The Indian, tamed, educated and inspired with a taste for white collars and moving-pictures, is as numerous as ever, but not so picturesque. On the little tracts of his great inheritance allotted him by civilization he is working out his own manifest destiny.. The buffalo has gone. Gone also is the stagecoach whose progress his pilgrimages often used to interrupt. Gone is the pony express, whose marvelous efficiency could compete with the wind, but not with the harnessed lightning flashed over the telegraph wires. Gone are the very bone-gatherers who laboriously collected the bleaching relics of the great herds that once dotted the prairies.. But the West of the old times, with its strong characters, its stern battles and its tremendous stretches of loneliness, can never be blotted from my mind. Nor can it, I hope, be blotted from the memory of the American people, to whom it has now become a priceless possession.. It has been my privilege to spend my working years on the frontier. I have known and served with commanders like Sherman, Sheridan, Miles, Custer and A.A. Carr — men who would be leaders in any army in any age. I have known and helped to fight with many of the most notable of the Indian warriors.. Frontiersmen good and bad, gunmen as well as inspired prophets of the future, have been my camp companions. Thus, I know the country of which I am about to write as few men now living have known it.. Recently, in the hope of giving permanent form to the history of the Plains, I staged many of the Indian battles for the films. Through the courtesy of the War and Interior Departments I had the help of the soldiers and the Indians.. Now that this work has been done I am again in the saddle and at your service for what I trust will be a pleasant and perhaps instructive journey over the old trails. We shall omit the hazards and the hardships, but often we shall leave the iron roads over which the Pullman rolls and, back in the hills, see the painted Indians winding up the draws, or watch the more savage Mormon Danites swoop down on the wagon-train.

A summary from the book's Preface:I have no apology to make, and no excuse to offer for writing this book, ""Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days'. It is not the result of vanity, neither is it a desire for notoriety, that prompted me to write it. No, my reasons are higher, and my purposes are nobler. My only desire has been to do good. The religious element runs through the entire story. . It has been a work of faith and a labor of love to me. I cannot express the pleasure I have had in sitting down, and recalling the incidents of my childhood and youth. In doing so, it has enabled me to live my life over again. I only hope that the reader will experience something of the same pleasure in reading the book that I have had in writing it. . The ""Brief Sketches of the Author"" were written just twenty years ago by the late Rev. J. Wofford White. He was a colored man, and a close friend of mine, and was born and reared in the same neighborhood with myself. These sketches were printed in The Christian Witness, a Boston newspaper, and were clipped and carefully pasted in my scrapbook. I republish them in this connection without changing a single word. I would ask the reader to peruse them carefully, and compare them with Chapter XI, entitled ""Little Jimmie, the Mail Boy,"" and note the similarity of characters. . I have written this book because there is no other work in existence just like it. No author, white or colored, so far as I know, has traversed, or attempted to traverse, the literary path which I presume to have trodden in writing this book. We are now about forty-five years away from the last days of slavery and the first days of freedom, and the people who have any personal knowledge of those days are rapidly crossing the mystic river, and entering the land that knows no shadows; and soon, there will not be one left to tell the story. And it is the author's thought that a record of the better life of those days should be left for the good of the future generations of this beautiful southland. Others have written of the evil side of those days, but the author felt it to be his mission to write of the better side. . Before the war, the relation that existed between the master and his slaves was, in most cases, one of tenderness and affection. There was a mutual attachment between them, which has commanded the admiration of the world. But since the war, an estrangement between the colored and the white races has sprung up, which has resulted in a feeling of intense bitterness and alienation. But I am glad to say that things are now taking a turn for the better. I can see signs of a better day ahead ; and if this book should, in any way, contribute to, and help on this much desired day, the author will be satisfied. . Chapters:Brief Sketches of the Author I.

In a new trans-genre form that combines short stories, short prose, and poetry, B.E. Hewson anthologizes the memories, emotions, and imaginings of a faith-failed adolescent colliding with an uninviting world. Virginity, rejection, familial angst, ignorance, fear, heartbreaking hope—Leave me alone captures snapshots of life in limbo between two worlds, a life struggling to break the barriers of a sheltered past only to find a cruel and unadjusted awakening. Readers will be intrigued and unnerved at Hewson’s unflinching honesty.

Readers may be confused or surprised. But one thing is for sure, readers will breech new territory. Never before has an author tried to portray the confines of growing up in a Mormon home and the chaos of never believing.

Parker and Robert Crais fans will enjoy 2011 ""Best Novel"" nominee Hallinan's overeducated private eye, Simeon Grist. In the second book in Hallinan's cult series, originally published in the 1990s, Grist takes a case, that leads him to the phantom neighborhoods of L.A.'s lost children.. Missing thirteen-year-old Aimee Sorrell, who ran all the way from Kansas to be a star. But Aimee's trail soon leads Simeon to the city morgue, the first stop on a perilous journey to find out what happens to America's lost children when they go looking for love in all the wrong places.. *From Publishers WeeklySimeon Grist, seen before in The Four Last Things , is an up-to-date private eye, a hip survivor of the Woodstock Generation bemused by current L.A. life. He's also a bit seedy, drinking too much and backsliding into cigarette smoking, with a wry outlook and heart of gold that keep him squarely in the hardboiled Hammett-Chandler tradition. Hired to find a 13-year-old runaway who left Kansas to become a Hollywood star, Simeon soon finds himself mired in L.A.'s seamy underworld of teenage hustlers, pimps and all-around losers. Using as decoys his teenage godchild Jessica and a young computer whiz smitten by her, Simeon uncovers a vast interstate ring involving a talent agency, a bent cop and high-tech kiddy-sex. While providing a nasty new meaning for a computer ""menu"" and some scenes not for the squeamish, Hallinan employs skillful pacing, L.A. color and Simeon's attractive persona to grip readers right through the gory climax and somewhat reassuring ending. Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc. . *From BooklistHallinan's first novel, The Four Last Things, introduced Southern California professor-turned-private-eye Simeon Grist and was notable for its superior plot, dialogue, and characterizations. The second Grist novel is as entertaining as the first, although its subject matter – child prostitution – is hardly light. Hired to find Aimee Sorrell, a 13-year-old runaway from Kansas City who has been kidnapped, Grist attempts to get a lead by hanging out with the young hookers and pimps who frequent the area between Sunset and Fountin Boulevards in Hollywood. His discoveries lead, first, to a strange alliance with the bizarre Mountain (a self-appointed guardian angel who tries to convince the runaways to go home) and, next, to the recruiting of Grist's goddaughter, Jessica, and her computer-nerd friend, Morris, to assist in the hunt for Aimee. Hallinan once again supplies a riveting story, and Grist continues to be one of the most intriguing of the new private eyes. Be forewarned, though: the denoument is grim indeed.. *From Library JournalSimeon Grist, persistently hard-nosed private eye, searches the draggy side of Los Angeles for a little lost rich girl. The 12-year-old's mother has received obscene pictures and a ransom note of sorts, so Grist, disgusted and enraged, dives into a graphic world of teenage prostitution, drug abuse, instant violence, colorful street people, and odious exploitation. By treating a grimly fascinating subject matter and location with sharp-voiced style and verve, Hallinan rises far above his first effort, The Four Last Things .Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc. . “Squeal combines high-octane action, baroque violence, humor, and pathos in a self-assured manner that marks Mr. Hallinan as a capable practitioner of the private eye tale.

Last year was one heck of a ride for 12-year old Mary Frances (“Frankie”) Jackson. She was an inning away from becoming the first female all-state middle-school pitcher … until a teammate double-crossed her. Then, she was arrested after she sought revenge against the double-crosser. And to top it off, her dad was banished from the family home after falling off the wagon. Now, she’s been sent to California for the summer to live on a houseboat with her Aunt Roxy. There’s one catch -- she can’t get in trouble or it’s back to New Jersey and juvenile detention camp.Too bad that days after arriving at the houseboat community, Frankie lands in hot water. Accused of animal cruelty (killing a cat), and with the evidence stacked against her, she has two weeks to prove her innocence. Frankie turns to a houseboat resident, Margie Britt, a washed out 70s TV star who used to solve mysteries on TV. But as the days pass, Frankie loses faith in Margie and initiates her own investigation. In the process she gets to know all of the eccentrics on the dock. There’s Forgetting Michael, a young disabled man, who forgets things whenever a loud noise goes off; Alice, an 82-year old activist who loves birds and hates cats; and there’s Butch, a German shepherd whose owner has a shady past. Frankie even learns the sad truth about Kay, her accuser.Ultimately, with help of Margie, Roxy, and her new houseboat friends, Frankie proves her innocence. But more importantly, Frankie learns how to deal with her own anger and frustration from the past year’s events. I Didn’t Kill Your Cat is a young adult novel with a tough, lovable, heroine and an intriguing setting – the houseboats of Sausalito"

Under cover of night, young ladies were spirited away from cities and town on the mainland and brought to the island for specialized training, preparing them for eventual placement in the homes of wealthy gentlemen with very specific tastes. When a pretty young redhead named Clara arrives, gagged, bound and bruised, she is assigned to Intake Cottage Number 7 and put under the strict but loving care of Nurse Ingrid.. There she is washed, fed and dressed in childish clothing as Nurse Ingrid begins teaching Clara to submit obediently to whatever demands may be made of her. Clara doesn`t know it yet but she is destined for the nursery of Lord Bardwick, a tall and demanding man who wants nothing more in life than a grown woman he may treat as a dependent child.. The first step in Clara`s training is learning to place herself, every evening and without complaint, across her nurse`s knee, where her bottom will be bared and dosed with a large and uncomfortable suppository. On Childebride Island, naughty, willful girls who don`t cooperate are punished immediately, and sound spankings and shaming with diapers are just some of the punishments meted out with alarming regularity.. This first book in the saga of ""Childebride Island: The Intake Cottage"" is now complete, with two exciting new chapters. Read the full story -- seven very long chapters -- as Clara undergoes little-girl training for an exacting man who is determined to make her his own. . *Publisher's note: Due to heavy demand from customers, the author has edited this novella in a M/M specific version.

"E1B24D52EC0F4797A99A4B1D937B17B0",,true,"Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days","This volume is from 1911. . A summary from the book's Preface:I have no apology to make, and no excuse to offer for writing this book, ""Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days'. It is not the result of vanity, neither is it a desire for notoriety, that prompted me to write it. No, my reasons are higher, and my purposes are nobler. My only desire has been to do good. The religious element runs through the entire story. . It has been a work of faith and a labor of love to me. I cannot express the pleasure I have had in sitting down, and recalling the incidents of my childhood and youth. In doing so, it has enabled me to live my life over again. I only hope that the reader will experience something of the same pleasure in reading the book that I have had in writing it. . The ""Brief Sketches of the Author"" were written just twenty years ago by the late Rev. J. Wofford White. He was a colored man, and a close friend of mine, and was born and reared in the same neighborhood with myself. These sketches were printed in The Christian Witness, a Boston newspaper, and were clipped and carefully pasted in my scrapbook. I republish them in this connection without changing a single word. I would ask the reader to peruse them carefully, and compare them with Chapter XI, entitled ""Little Jimmie, the Mail Boy,"" and note the similarity of characters. . I have written this book because there is no other work in existence just like it. No author, white or colored, so far as I know, has traversed, or attempted to traverse, the literary path which I presume to have trodden in writing this book. We are now about forty-five years away from the last days of slavery and the first days of freedom, and the people who have any personal knowledge of those days are rapidly crossing the mystic river, and entering the land that knows no shadows; and soon, there will not be one left to tell the story. And it is the author's thought that a record of the better life of those days should be left for the good of the future generations of this beautiful southland. Others have written of the evil side of those days, but the author felt it to be his mission to write of the better side. . Before the war, the relation that existed between the master and his slaves was, in most cases, one of tenderness and affection. There was a mutual attachment between them, which has commanded the admiration of the world. But since the war, an estrangement between the colored and the white races has sprung up, which has resulted in a feeling of intense bitterness and alienation. But I am glad to say that things are now taking a turn for the better. I can see signs of a better day ahead ; and if this book should, in any way, contribute to, and help on this much desired day, the author will be satisfied. . Chapters:Brief Sketches of the Author I.

Maybe it’s karma, but sparks of frustration turn into the heat of attraction and within the week the pair are involved in an interracial romance with plenty of explicit sex. . But just when things start really heating up, cruel fate steps in at Christmas vacation, when, after a second snafu, the lovebirds are separated the by an ocean of despair—the Atlantic Ocean. . EXCERPTWhen we got back to our room, Rene headed to one of the baths we would be sharing with three other students, while I simply threw on a nightshirt and hopped in bed. I just lay there and reflected on what Tami said. I'd naively thought I had my future at Juilliard mapped out. Rene would be my roommate and best friend for this year. For the next three years since the dorms were mostly for freshmen, I figured we could share an inexpensive two bedroom, New York flat. I wasn't naive, I knew those seven words, an inexpensive two bedroom, New York flat, created an oxymoron, but I'm an optimist.. In the middle of my contemplation, Rene returned. His hair, now darkened and damp, hung uncombed, but that wasn't what caught my attention. The only thing that kept him from standing naked before me was a white towel wrapped around and tucked in his waist.. He smiled. ""Turn your head, ma chere, while I put my pajamas bottoms on."". I did, but I snuck a peek. My mouth watered as he turned his backside to me and dropped the towel. His broad shoulders and muscular chest veed into a narrow waist and ultra-sexy taut buns and that wasn't all. One at a time, he lifted a foot into each pajama leg, his shoulder muscles rippling, but before he pulled them up into place, every ounce of oxygen in my lungs exhaled and my pussy muscles clenched. From betwixt his muscular legs, the underside of his sex, the tip of his penis and his pinkish mauve scrotum, beckoned to me and I couldn't catch my breath. Finally when I thought I would pass out from oxygen deprivation, I gasped a breath of life.. Rene swung around, concern etched on his beautiful face. ""Are you all right?"". My eyelids rose and I gasped again as blood rushed to my clit and pussy. His long, thick male member dangled from the opening in his pajamas.. He looked down and quickly inserted himself. ""Sorry,"" he uttered, but the damage had been done.. The damage, of course, was to my idyllic concept of how we could be platonic friends and roommates for the next four years. ""Girl, you're going to be the horniest dancer in Juilliard. And what about him? Is he supposed to go without for four years?"" What Tami had been trying to tell me slammed into my mind like a head on collision. Why hadn't this been a problem last night? Because, you idiot, you both fell asleep in your clothes after talking half the night.. He smiled. ""Are you going to sleep?"". ""If I can."". ""Would it bother you if I did some things on my computer?"". Apparently on the way to losing my mind, I blurted out, ""This wouldn't be a problem if you weren't so God damned good looking,"" and rolled over to face the wall.. ""What?"". My head turned back part way. ""Never mind, forget I said that."". The mattress sank behind me and then a tender stroke brushed my arm. ""No, mon amour, what is bothering you?"". I turned back over onto my back and raised up on my elbows. ""I'm sorry, I'm so mixed up right now, it's driving me crazy."". SUB-GENRES INCLUDED Erotic RomanceBWWMRomance and SexBDSM"

One day she discovered a cave on her grandfather’s property, but it wasn’t just any cave. This one contained a library, a reading chair, and a mysterious man by the name of Douglas. . Perhaps it was the darkness of the cave. Or perhaps it was because Douglas was hiding from the world, too, but a friendship developed and then an attraction. . Louisa was adamant about discovering the reason Douglas was hiding, just as he was determined to keep Louisa from figuring out that he wasn’t exactly human. .

Now an adult, he's a responsible and respected member of the Silver Springs Fire Department. But with all he has achieved, there is one thing he still longs for…Veronica Abbott. The sweet, innocent, rich girl was always been out of his league, but that never stopped her from monopolizing his dreams. Now she's back, and the woman she has become leaves Dean with his jaw touching the floor! After a life of domineering parents and becoming a widow in her mid-twenties, Veronica is finally in control of her future. And a future of excitement, surprise and spice is exactly what she wants. Her new business—a shop of sexual favors and lingerie—is sure to give her some of that, but it’s the prospect of Dean Wolcott that really lights the fire inside her.   Genre: Erotic Contemporary [contains graphic sexual content and adult language] Length: Novel (41,000 words) 5 Stars, 2006 Reviewers' Choice Award Nominee: ""Tonya Ramagos is an author who never fails to tell a great story. Caught Off Guard is most definitely one of those. Dean and Veronica are two characters that harbored a secret crush for each other all of their lives but didn't necessarily know it. I loved that Dean (picture totally hot, buff firefighter) is so in touch with what he wants. He's dreamed of Veronica for years. Even believing that he had no chance, a tiny spark was always there. Veronica is a woman who has finally taken control of her life. She's straightforward in her attraction to Dean and goes after him with a single-mindedness that is enviable. Their initial meeting when she comes back to town knocked my socks off and the blazing hot attraction between these two continues throughout the book. They both have to examine what they want and decide whether they are ready to try to find happiness together. Although their relationship occurs quickly, it flows well in this fast paced tale and only the wrap up felt rushed. If you're looking for a quick, hot read, then grab Caught Off Guard."" —Trang, Ecataromance 5 Angels: ""Caught Off Guard explodes with passion and longing! Dean and Veronica share some pretty serious fantasies of each other, but as they find out, the reality is definitely better than either could ever have imagined. I really liked Veronica. She was very take-charge and upfront about her desire for Dean, while being equally upfront about her hesitations for a deeper relationship. She didn't hide what she was feeling and thus, though she couldn't always give Dean the answers he wanted, at least he knew that there was hope for a stronger relationship to spark.      Tonya Ramagos has been on my author radar for awhile and this book just cements her place on my keeper shelf. Perhaps a simple romance plot-wise, the emotional intensity of these characters marks this story as a winner. I hope Ms. Ramagos has plans to write about the other firefighters of Silver Springs."" —Sarah W., Fallen Angel Reviews5 Cups: ""What is hotter than a fireman love story? How about a mature woman that is ready to embrace her sensual side? This book hooked me from the very first page. This story draws you in with the action and the layers of details. I have to say that I loved reading it and hope you do too."" —Missy, Coffee Time Romance"

The Terro-Human Future History is Piper's detailed account of the next 6000 years of human history. 1942, the year the first fission reactor was constructed, is defined as the year 1 A.E. (Atomic Era). In 1973, a nuclear war devastates the planet, eventually laying the groundwork for the emergence of a Terran Federation, once humanity goes into space and develops antigravity technology.. It's important to note that many of these stories work fine as stand-alone books and you don't necessarily have to read them in order.. The story ""The Edge of the Knife"" (Book One) occurs slightly before the war, and involves a man who sees flashes of the future. It links many key elements of Piper's series.. Most of the stories take place during the next millennium, during the age of the two Federations. Most notable among these novels Little Fuzzy, which concerns the recognition of a peculiar alien species as sapient, and the efforts of the two species to learn to live together on the Fuzzies' home adopted world of Zarathustra.. The Federation collapses in the System States War and following Interstellar Wars (a bit of which can be seen in Book Eight: The Cosmic Computer), leading to a lengthy time of instability, during which there is no central human power. Space Viking is set in this chaotic period.. Piper's future history resemble in some ways Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, and was probably influenced by it.. This volume includes two of the most loved science fiction stories ever written:. Little Fuzzy--The story revolves around determining whether a small furry species discovered on the planet Zarathustra is sapient. Along the way a gentle kind of libertarianism that emphasizes sincerity and honesty is advocated. But things are not as simple or as nice as they appear to be.... Space Viking--One day, a starship rediscovered the Old Federation. Civilization had collapsed, presumably due to the war; many of the planets had regressed to varying stages of semi-barbarism. Taking advantage of the situation, space vikings proceeded to raid the poorly defended Federation worlds over the next three hundred years for loot.. In the face of this isolation and the political instability, Lucas Trask, seeks to avenge his wife's murderer and discover his true destiny.... In this volume:.

A summary from the book's Preface:I have no apology to make, and no excuse to offer for writing this book, ""Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days'. It is not the result of vanity, neither is it a desire for notoriety, that prompted me to write it. No, my reasons are higher, and my purposes are nobler. My only desire has been to do good. The religious element runs through the entire story. . It has been a work of faith and a labor of love to me. I cannot express the pleasure I have had in sitting down, and recalling the incidents of my childhood and youth. In doing so, it has enabled me to live my life over again. I only hope that the reader will experience something of the same pleasure in reading the book that I have had in writing it. . The ""Brief Sketches of the Author"" were written just twenty years ago by the late Rev. J. Wofford White. He was a colored man, and a close friend of mine, and was born and reared in the same neighborhood with myself. These sketches were printed in The Christian Witness, a Boston newspaper, and were clipped and carefully pasted in my scrapbook. I republish them in this connection without changing a single word. I would ask the reader to peruse them carefully, and compare them with Chapter XI, entitled ""Little Jimmie, the Mail Boy,"" and note the similarity of characters. . I have written this book because there is no other work in existence just like it. No author, white or colored, so far as I know, has traversed, or attempted to traverse, the literary path which I presume to have trodden in writing this book. We are now about forty-five years away from the last days of slavery and the first days of freedom, and the people who have any personal knowledge of those days are rapidly crossing the mystic river, and entering the land that knows no shadows; and soon, there will not be one left to tell the story. And it is the author's thought that a record of the better life of those days should be left for the good of the future generations of this beautiful southland. Others have written of the evil side of those days, but the author felt it to be his mission to write of the better side. . Before the war, the relation that existed between the master and his slaves was, in most cases, one of tenderness and affection. There was a mutual attachment between them, which has commanded the admiration of the world. But since the war, an estrangement between the colored and the white races has sprung up, which has resulted in a feeling of intense bitterness and alienation. But I am glad to say that things are now taking a turn for the better. I can see signs of a better day ahead ; and if this book should, in any way, contribute to, and help on this much desired day, the author will be satisfied. . Chapters:Brief Sketches of the Author I.

An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: A True Story (also called the Red Book).. The Bell Witch or Bell Witch Haunting is a poltergeist legend from Southern United States folklore, involving the Bell family of Adams, Tennessee. The legend is the basis of the films An American Haunting (2006) and The Bell Witch Haunting (2004), and may have influenced the production of The Blair Witch Project (1999).. According to the legend, the first manifestation of the haunting occurred in 1817 when John William Bell, Sr. encountered a strange animal in a cornfield on his large farm in Robertson County, on the Red River, near Adams, Tennessee.. This incident was quickly followed by a series of strange beating and gnawing noises manifesting outside and eventually inside the Bell residence. Betsy Bell, the family's younger daughter claimed to have been assaulted by an invisible force.. Some people believe that the spirit returned in 1935, the year when the witch claimed it would return (""one hundred years and seven"" past 1828), and took up residence on the former Bell property. . The most famous account is recorded in what has come to be called the Red Book, the 1894 An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch of Tennessee by Martin Van Buren Ingram, which cites the earlier Richard William Bell's Diary: Our Family Trouble. Richard Williams Bell lists several witnesses, including General (later President) Andrew Jackson. . That account and also an account of a related incident, The Mississippi Bell Witch account are included in this volume. Bell Witch legends are almost as prevalent in Mississippi as they are in Tennessee because of the fact that the families of two of John Bell's children moved to Mississippi in the 1830's.

Of Don Dennis, Charles ""Chuck"" Colson said: ""I first met Don Dennis in Walla Walla prison. . . . He was a tough, hard con who gave his heart to the Lord and has been just as tough ever since--but now as a warrior for Christ. A wonderful example of God's grace: the One who can save a Don Dennis or a Chuck Colson can save anyone."". A portion of this book, in somewhat different form, was originally published by Broadman Press in 1993 under the title Breaking Crime's Vicious Cycle.. Excerpt from the book From the Cell to the Cross:. In 1977 Don Dennis stood at attention before a judge in a Seattle, Washington, courtroom.. ""Mr. Dennis,"" the judge began, ""you have been in and out of prison for more than twenty years. After reviewing your history of felonies, escapes, forgeries, and other crimes against society, I am sentencing you to life in prison.. That was Don Dennis, the habitual criminal. Then, he looked at life this way: ""It was me and my prison buddies at war against the police, guards, society. We were like blood brothers."" Don was more comfortable behind prison walls than in free society. Each time he went back into prison, it was like ""going home."" That's where his friends were; that's where people understood him, or so he thought.. More than twenty years later that Don Dennis was no more. He was a man with a different kind of mission. Rather than tearing down, he was building up by helping prisoners and ex-prisoners find a new way of looking at life.. This is the story of how Don Dennis got from there to here. It is nothing short of a miracle.. About the Authors. For almost twenty years, Don Dennis led a group of volunteers in a prison ministry. The efforts of Don Dennis Ministries were recognized with a number of awards. In 1996 he and his group were named Outstanding Religious Group of the Year by the Texas Youth Commission and the Religious Group of the Year by the Gainesville State School. In 1997 he received the Governor's Faithful Service Award from Texas Governor George Bush. This was followed in 1998 with the Governor's Volunteer Service Award for Faithfulness to the Texas Youth Commission..

"36952A9CA49E44D3AA76EE01B4FC10E5",,true,"Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days","This volume is from 1911. . A summary from the book's Preface:I have no apology to make, and no excuse to offer for writing this book, ""Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days'. It is not the result of vanity, neither is it a desire for notoriety, that prompted me to write it. No, my reasons are higher, and my purposes are nobler. My only desire has been to do good. The religious element runs through the entire story. . It has been a work of faith and a labor of love to me. I cannot express the pleasure I have had in sitting down, and recalling the incidents of my childhood and youth. In doing so, it has enabled me to live my life over again. I only hope that the reader will experience something of the same pleasure in reading the book that I have had in writing it. . The ""Brief Sketches of the Author"" were written just twenty years ago by the late Rev. J. Wofford White. He was a colored man, and a close friend of mine, and was born and reared in the same neighborhood with myself. These sketches were printed in The Christian Witness, a Boston newspaper, and were clipped and carefully pasted in my scrapbook. I republish them in this connection without changing a single word. I would ask the reader to peruse them carefully, and compare them with Chapter XI, entitled ""Little Jimmie, the Mail Boy,"" and note the similarity of characters. . I have written this book because there is no other work in existence just like it. No author, white or colored, so far as I know, has traversed, or attempted to traverse, the literary path which I presume to have trodden in writing this book. We are now about forty-five years away from the last days of slavery and the first days of freedom, and the people who have any personal knowledge of those days are rapidly crossing the mystic river, and entering the land that knows no shadows; and soon, there will not be one left to tell the story. And it is the author's thought that a record of the better life of those days should be left for the good of the future generations of this beautiful southland. Others have written of the evil side of those days, but the author felt it to be his mission to write of the better side. . Before the war, the relation that existed between the master and his slaves was, in most cases, one of tenderness and affection. There was a mutual attachment between them, which has commanded the admiration of the world. But since the war, an estrangement between the colored and the white races has sprung up, which has resulted in a feeling of intense bitterness and alienation. But I am glad to say that things are now taking a turn for the better. I can see signs of a better day ahead ; and if this book should, in any way, contribute to, and help on this much desired day, the author will be satisfied. . Chapters:Brief Sketches of the Author I.

Luca Veste . DIRTY OLD TOWN is the debut collection from the prize-winning writer Nigel Bird. His brilliantly observed slices of life allow us to visit places we may not normally choose to enter and to walk a few miles in the shoes of others. . Though his tales have darkness at their core, they are also full of a heart and spirit that one rarely finds in the world or ‘noir’ or ‘crime-writing’.. There are 9 stories here: Drinking Wine (Spo-Dee-Oh-Dee); Dirty Old Town; Sea Minor; Sisterhood; One Hundred And Ten Per Cent; Merry Christmas (I Don’t Want To Fight Tonight); Three Little Birds; and Silver Street. Each will remain with you for days after you’ve read it. Some will be around for weeks. . In this collection we meet a frustrated housewife who needs to let her hair down; an elderly school janitor who can’t see the wood for the trees; a group of Muslims intent on revenge; a young girl whose father has just left home; a father and son breaking-and-entering partnership; a young man working on a city farm; and a pimp who’s fallen in love. All of them struggle to meet life’s demands and some of them cope better than others.. Five of the stories here have been published by the highly respected editors of The Reader Magazine, A Twist Of Noir, Beat To A Pulp, Title Fights, Static Movement and Dark Valentine. The collection also includes two pieces that are being given their first outing and another that was put together put for the Big Beat From Badsville's Ramones series. . The story 'Sisterhood' was selected for publication in Mammoth's Best British Crime Stories 9.. In 2010 Nigel Bird was the winner of the prestigious Watery Grave Invitational competition hosted by the Drowning Machine. Since then he has gone on to win the Things I’d Rather Be Doing fairytale/crime-story competition.. Praise for Nigel Bird and his work includes:. 'The stories have well written plots and all have unexpected endings which are not obvious when reading them. I found the stories to be well conceived and ideal to read in ebook format. I hope that Nigel is able to write a full size novel to further develop his writing skills. Some of the short stories here could easily have been the base for a much longer book.' Paul Blackburn (at Euro Crime). ‘This is crime writing at its best. Read this collection, it is a crime not to do so.’ Richard Godwin (Apostle Rising). 'Each story is short and sweet, most with a nice wicked twist at the end. The blurb accompanying the collection says that the stories will stay with you for a while. A couple of them have certainly been rattling round my head for a few days. I did have one complaint, however – I wanted more of them! A nice collection.' Rob Kitchin (View From The Blue Room). ‘I was surprised by every story. These are short, punchy, thoughtful, hard as a punch, but sometimes they dig in and squeeze. It's dirty stuff, done beautifully.Nigel is also responsible for the too-cool ""Dancing With Myself"" interview series at his blog, Sea Minor.” Anthony Neil Smith (Yellow Medicine, Psychosomatic, Hogdoggin') ‘Taking A Line For A Walk’, included here, was listed among the top 5 stories of 2010 by Bill Hayes and Naomi Johnson over at Death By Killing.. 'It won't take long to realise he is also one of the best writers out there on the noir scene' Ian Ayris (Abide With Me). ‘A rare talent.’ Allan Guthrie (Bye Bye Baby, Hard Man, Slammer) ‘So nice to read a story with this much heart in it.’ Patti Abbott (Discount Noir, Pattinase) ‘Great Stuff.’ Charlie Stella (Charlie Opera, Johnny Porno). ‘Brilliantly razor-sharp, jagged slice of life.’ Paul D Brazill (ubiquitous, You Would Say That Wouldn’t You). ‘I sought out everything I could from him. I dare you to read and not do the same.’ Chris F Holm (8 Pounds). ‘Took my breath away...Powerful.’ Kathleen A Ryan"

Beam Piper (Twelve Terro-Human Future History Novels in One Volume)","NOTE: This edition has a linked ""Table of Contents"" and has been beautifully formatted (searchable and interlinked) to work on your Amazon e-book reader, Amazon Desktop Reader, and your ipod e-book reader.. The Terro-Human Future History is Piper's detailed account of the next 6000 years of human history. 1942, the year the first fission reactor was constructed, is defined as the year 1 A.E. (Atomic Era). In 1973, a nuclear war devastates the planet, eventually laying the groundwork for the emergence of a Terran Federation, once humanity goes into space and develops antigravity technology.. It's important to note that many of these stories work fine as stand-alone books and you don't necessarily have to read them in order.. The story ""The Edge of the Knife"" (Book One) occurs slightly before the war, and involves a man who sees flashes of the future. It links many key elements of Piper's series.. Most of the stories take place during the next millennium, during the age of the two Federations. Most notable among these novels Little Fuzzy, which concerns the recognition of a peculiar alien species as sapient, and the efforts of the two species to learn to live together on the Fuzzies' home adopted world of Zarathustra.. The Federation collapses in the System States War and following Interstellar Wars (a bit of which can be seen in Book Eight: The Cosmic Computer), leading to a lengthy time of instability, during which there is no central human power. Space Viking is set in this chaotic period.. Piper's future history resemble in some ways Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, and was probably influenced by it.. This volume includes two of the most loved science fiction stories ever written:. Little Fuzzy--The story revolves around determining whether a small furry species discovered on the planet Zarathustra is sapient. Along the way a gentle kind of libertarianism that emphasizes sincerity and honesty is advocated. But things are not as simple or as nice as they appear to be.... Space Viking--One day, a starship rediscovered the Old Federation. Civilization had collapsed, presumably due to the war; many of the planets had regressed to varying stages of semi-barbarism. Taking advantage of the situation, space vikings proceeded to raid the poorly defended Federation worlds over the next three hundred years for loot.. In the face of this isolation and the political instability, Lucas Trask, seeks to avenge his wife's murderer and discover his true destiny.... In this volume:. Book One: The Edge of the KnifeBook Two: OmnilingualBook Three: Four-Day PlanetBook Four: Uller UprisingBook Five: NaudsonceBook Six: Little FuzzyBook Seven: Oomphel in the SkyBook Eight: The Cosmic ComputerBook Nine: Space VikingBook Ten: A Slave is a SlaveBook Eleven: Ministry of DisturbanceBook Twelve: The Keeper.

When Isaac Newton figured out the law of gravity from a falling apple, everything changed. When Benjamin Franklin harvested electricity from lightening and Thomas Edison made the first commercial light bulb, everything changed. Today, when quantum physicists realize our physical universe isn’t real, that it’s just a hologram, everything … wait! Nothing’s changed - yet. ""Butterflies Are Free To Fly"" offers a new and radical approach to spiritual evolution based on the recent scientific experiments in quantum physics and brain research outlined in Part One. Given that the physical universe which looks and feels so real to us is actually a unique holographic projection from our own brain, the author examines various models for life and living that are very different than what we have been told and taught. “This is the only radical thinking that you need to do,” Dr. Amit Goswami is quoted as saying. “But it is so radical, it is so difficult, because our tendency is that the world is already ‘out there,’ independent of my experience. It is not. Quantum Physics has been so clear about it.” For example, in Part Two we are introduced to something the author calls an “Infinite I,” which is creating our unique holographic experiences. Then there is the “Human Game Model,” offering explanations all the way from why we experience pain and suffering to how we can change our reactions and responses by letting go of our judgments, beliefs, opinions, and fears. The end result, suggests the author, is peeling away all the layers of false identities that make up the “ego,” transforming and emerging from our cocoon as a “no-self.” Part Three of the book is a series of questions and answers to offer alternative explanations consistent with these models on subjects such as money, past lives, karma, trust, and the “Earth Environment.”This book will leave you thinking, because this book is truly radical."

TROUBLEDWhen twelve-year-old Freeman Mills arrives at Wendover, a group home for troubled children, it’s a chance for a fresh start. But second chances aren’t easy for Freeman, the victim of painful childhood experiments that gave him the ability to read other people’s minds.. Little does Freeman know that his transfer was made at the request of Dr. Richard Kracowski, whose research into the brain’s electrical properties is revealing new powers of the human mind. Kracowski is working for a secret society called the Trust, but also has his own agenda in exploring the nature of the soul. His experiments have an unexpected side effect, though. The electromagnetic fields used in his experiments are summoning the ghosts of the patients who died at Wendover back when it was a psychiatric ward.. Freeman simply wants to survive, take his medicine for manic depression, and deceive his counselors into believing he is happy. When he meets the anorexic Vicky, who may also be telepathic, he’s afraid some of his darkest secrets will be uncovered. But when the other children develop their own clairvoyant abilities, and insane spirits begin haunting the halls of Wendover, he can’t safely hide inside his own head anymore..

His life seems a cruel joke until he meets beautiful, independent Margaret Farnsworth. Margaret, a promised woman, sees only that strong, capable Roy is just the man to guide her through the badlands in search of her brother. . As eastern-bred Margaret struggles to overcome the hardships of the west, Roy’s pleasuring hands and kisses inevitably tear her between two worlds. A marked man, Roy can never give Margaret the respectability she deserves, yet he turns his back on his western code of honor as he dallies with the betrothed beauty. . Excerpt Copyright 2009. Margaret thrust her hands onto her hips and stiffened her back ramrod straight. “Not that it’s any of your business, but my brother sent a telegram to me, asking for my help. He’s in trouble, and sick!” . Margaret felt fear squeeze her heart, and an urgent burning in the pit of her stomach at the thought of her brother suffering somewhere out on this endless prairie. She was driven to see him safe, and if she had to beat off every scoundrel and outlaw in this territory, including this one, well then by God she’d do it. . “Well, that makes me glad I’m not your brother,” Roy scoffed. . “I’m glad, too! My brother wouldn’t smell like cheap perfume!” she lashed back. Margaret was worldly enough to know that western men, like the wild territory, couldn’t be tamed by the mere presence of grace and civility. .

Roy chuckled. “My mama, bless her soul, would tan my bottom for forgetting my manners with a lady.” He yanked off his hat, and affected an exaggerated sweeping bow that propelled his thick dark hair forward to frame the hard angles of his face. . “Roy Easton.”. Margaret softened. “Miss Margaret Victoria Taylor Farnsworth.” She extended her hand and smiled. “And thank you for helping me out . . . out of my predicament.” Roy grinned at the woman who hauled a name long enough to need two mules to carry it. He reached to take her smooth white hand, inhaled her intoxicating rose scent, and, feeling a stirring in his groin, he stifled a silent groan. . It was the kind of trouble he didn’t need, especially not now. As his hard cowboy hand met hers in a gentle clasp, he subconsciously registered the fact that she came from the gussied-up stock known as eastern nobility. Sure as steers stampede, those soft-as-silk hands hadn’t known a day of hard work. His rough ones, by contrast, belonged to a hardworking rancher-turned-ex-lawman.. BOOKS IN THE SERIES.

In the middle of the night these peacekeepers are attacked, but the lieutenant in charge of the unit gets a message to the base and activates the unit’s emergency beacon. The Peacekeeper and a squadron of fighters head for the location at top speed. When they arrive they find an incredible nightmare awaiting them as they investigate the deaths of their fellow peacekeepers. Following the clues and the evidence they soon discover that a deadly cult has formed and has grown to the point that they have become a serious threat to the safety of the people of the region. If a heavily armed, professionally trained group of peacekeepers didn’t stand a chance against these people the peacekeeper council knows that no one is safe. One by one the numerous nests had to be located and the cult members dealt with if the people of the area were to survive. What follows is a descent into the mindset of the hardcore cult member. To defeat an enemy one must understand that enemy. But understanding this enemy is a descent into madness and is the darkest encounter that the peacekeepers have ever faced.

Emma Wildes’ unique writing style is edgy and erotic. Robert’s tenderness is sweet and sexy while Celia’s acceptance of him and her situation is both moving and emotional. These two sensual characters create enough heat to warm you on the coldest of nights and will have you reaching for ice when things get too hot. I anxiously look forward to the remaining stories in the Brothers of the Absinthe Club series. If they’re anything like Arabian Pearl, I'll need to free up more space on my Keeper shelf!"" —Kerin, Two Lips Reviews5 Hearts: ""WOW!! Arabian Pearl is an amazing story. When Celia realizes the situation, she offers herself to Robert. Ms. Wildes has an incredible storytelling talent and she shows it here. Celia is a beautiful and innocent young woman who is seduced by Robert, a handsome and knowledgeable man. Their sexual encounters are beyond erotic; each night for twelve nights Robert teaches Celia something new. I was trembling in my chair as I read about their exploits. Celia grows in this story from an innocent child to an adult and sexually aware young woman. Robert knows that what he is doing is against all the rules of his society, but he does not want Celia punished and thrown into a far corner of the harem. Although they are not allowed to discuss their lives in England, they manage to get to know each other in whispers. I was simply enthralled by this story and I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys a beautiful, graphic and erotic love story."" —Marcy Arbitman, The Romance Studio5 Angels: ""This reader found Arabian Pearl a most interesting read that not only charms but titillates as well. This fascinating tale allows the reader to escape into a world of sultans, harems, and a beautiful love slave with her English lord. Even though Celia and Robert’s story is so much different from the other beautiful women in Celia’s predicament, I found my heart going out to those women who couldn’t be helped and had to suffer their fate when they were sold into slavery. Emma Wildes blends some wonderful characters, romance, and a bit of history to make a sensual read that keeps the readers interest. She paints characters with so much emotion that touch the reader, especially the poor women in bondage, yet she creates a very poignant love story between Celia and Robert that is remarkably breathtaking making this one excellent read."" —Linda L., Fallen Angel Reviews"

Furthermore, not only will he not work with the much-anticipated nuclear weapon of his vivid imagination but he will work in another supply room in close contact with all of the people who were too stupid, too naive, or too crazy to leave the job while the leaving was good.. Every day will be a trial for Skeet as he attempts to glean some sort of lesson from what life has presented to him. His commanding officer is an avid John Wayne fan who wears a Stetson because he can. One of the lieutenants is a buxom, blonde beauty commonly known as Lieutenant Cupcake because of the fluff between her ears. One of the sergeants is an overrated infantryman who detests every kind of air defense artillery soldier and especially detests Skeet. Another sergeant is a supply sergeant who is addicted to Pepto Bismo and afraid that he will have to pay for all the things that have gone missing in the detachment. An unknown individual with an odd predilection for smearing his own bodily wastes on various pieces of equipment haunts the unit after the midnight hour. Every single person there has some sort of twisted issue and each one is not afraid to let those issues out to flop around the floor like dead fishes."
