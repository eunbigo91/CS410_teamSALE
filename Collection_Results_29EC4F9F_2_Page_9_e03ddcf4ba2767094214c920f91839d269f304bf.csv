The more Nathan tries to protect Lady Iona from running head-long into disgrace, the more he admires her daring spirit and unpredictable antics. Instead of returning her to the obedient world to which she was raised, he encourages her blossoming passions. Such a move is surely going to lead them both to ruin.. But for love he is willing to risk everything.. Filled with emotion and torment, a steamy romance in which the hero and heroine can barely keep their hands off of each other, and a tender, heartbreaking realization and reconciliation, LADY IONA'S REBELLION meets every requirement that we deem necessary for it to be a Perfect 10. The writing is crisp, the tension so thick that you can cut it with a knife, and the cast so alive and vivacious, down to even the most secondary of characters. ~ A Perfect 10! ~ Romance Reviews Today. Lady Iona's Rebellion took me by storm. Not only is the writing grand, but the whole premise of the storyline is beautifully created. Iona is sassy and bright and I loved how she stands her ground for her independence. A hot-blooded Nathan and a desirable Iona, wow, this story sizzles with excitement, passion and the natural interference of families. Dorothy McFalls develops an intriguing read where characters linger long after the story ends. The well-sculptured secondary characters definitely put a spin on the story. This is one tantalizing read that is truly extraordinary in a most satisfying way. ~ 4 Cups! ~ Coffee Time Romance. LADY IONA'S REBELLION by Dorothy McFalls is an outrageous romp through Regency England with two wonderfully compelling characters as they find themselves dodging scandal on the way to discovering love. ~ 4 Ribbons! ~ Romance Junkies. The plot is fresh and adventuresome and each sister, brother, parent, friend and servant were a tribute to this wonderful story of confusion! The more Iona and Nathan experienced together, the more involved the events became! Each time Nathan did anything, it was perceived as scandalous; Lady Iona had the sympathy of the entire ton because, since she was known as the malleable child, it was never expected that she had anything to do with the outrage! This is a meticulous novel in which Ms. Dorothy McFalls showed her vast talent in the expansion of this book. I literally could not put it down. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves regency romance. This book will go well on your ""keeper"" list!~ 5 Hearts! ~ The Romance Studio. Dorothy McFalls has written a fantastic romantic tale, one which is easy to read, engaging and entertaining. ... It is this attention to detail that pulled me completely into this story and made me forget I wasn't right there on the pages with Lady Iona and Lord Nathan. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am eagerly awaiting any new book by Dorothy McFalls. Lady Iona's Rebellion is top rate on all fronts and I am sure whatever follows will be just as good. Well done! ~ 5 Angels! ~ Fallen Angel Reviews. Lady Iona is full of spit and fire and Lord Nathan is charmingly earnest. I kept on laughing throughout this story because of all the situations they get into. ... I haven't been this amused by a book in a long time. The pace is wonderful and you don't want to walk away from it...Lady Iona's Rebellion is a definite must read.~ 5 Stars! ~ Manic Readers"

This research showed, as it really brings out realism in this book and makes it very enjoyable from my perspective as a horse owner.”—Ross A. “I have just finished reading your book DARK HORSE. To say that it was great is putting it mildly. I have been involved with horse racing, both at recognized tracks, as well as match racing all my adult life. … I won the 1985 All American Futurity with Mr. Trucka Jet. … I read all of Dick Francis’s books, as well as Shoemaker’s two, and I must say that I enjoyed reading your book every bit as much as anything they have written. If not more. Keep up the good work.”—Wade N."

An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: A True Story (also called the Red Book).. The Bell Witch or Bell Witch Haunting is a poltergeist legend from Southern United States folklore, involving the Bell family of Adams, Tennessee. The legend is the basis of the films An American Haunting (2006) and The Bell Witch Haunting (2004), and may have influenced the production of The Blair Witch Project (1999).. According to the legend, the first manifestation of the haunting occurred in 1817 when John William Bell, Sr. encountered a strange animal in a cornfield on his large farm in Robertson County, on the Red River, near Adams, Tennessee.. This incident was quickly followed by a series of strange beating and gnawing noises manifesting outside and eventually inside the Bell residence. Betsy Bell, the family's younger daughter claimed to have been assaulted by an invisible force.. Some people believe that the spirit returned in 1935, the year when the witch claimed it would return (""one hundred years and seven"" past 1828), and took up residence on the former Bell property. . The most famous account is recorded in what has come to be called the Red Book, the 1894 An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch of Tennessee by Martin Van Buren Ingram, which cites the earlier Richard William Bell's Diary: Our Family Trouble. Richard Williams Bell lists several witnesses, including General (later President) Andrew Jackson. . That account and also an account of a related incident, The Mississippi Bell Witch account are included in this volume. Bell Witch legends are almost as prevalent in Mississippi as they are in Tennessee because of the fact that the families of two of John Bell's children moved to Mississippi in the 1830's.

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

This time, the stakes are her trust fund, her freedom, and even her single status. To win, she must take her father's seed money and create a successful lingerie company in one year with no help from any outside sources. Six months into it, out of money and deeply in debt, she hires a handsome hunk to make her catalog sizzle and her sales soar. But far from being a typical lingerie model, there's more to Gabriel Wallace than meets her eyes or her hands. . To My Readers: Double Exposure is a story very dear to my heart. Lacy and Gabe deserve each other, but parental interference threatens their chance at happiness. How many of us have had the same experience? I hope you enjoy reading their story as much as I enjoyed writing it. . Rating: 4/5 Stars! Heat level: H. Launching a lingerie company, Satin and Steel on a limited budget wasn't easy but for Lacy Fitzgerald it is the end of the line. She has to stand up on her feet and make her dear dad realize that he has a sensible daughter who can make effective business deals just like he does. A last minute search for a handsome hunky lingerie model brings her face to face with Gabe Matthews and she feels that his appeal as a rugged construction worker would help her to generate sales. What she doesn't know is that this particular man has lots up his sleeve that would make her fall for him in no time!. Lacy may appear a carefree young woman with only fun on her mind, but really emerges as a responsible person when the need arises. I know I should hate her father for forcing her into earning a living for herself but it turns out that parents really do know more. I never thought that Gabe would be a man to say yes when he doesn't want to but Lacy's charm makes him do things that he never meant to do. I found myself secretly smirking as Lacy's outrageous underwear made Gabe cringe. It really felt like lust at first sight, as the couple never shared their feelings for each other. True, their hot escapades make you hum with excitement but I felt love was lacking somewhere along the line. Sparks from the exciting chemistry that they share had my insides singing in no time. The plot fulfills the demands of a fun contemporary romance and you find yourself pulled in while the couple is trying on raunchy lingerie. Lacy's dear friend, Suzanne Santini is an interesting character and I wouldn't mind meeting her in her own story.. For a debut, Ms. Scott shows real promise and I expect truly dreamy delightful tales from her. Mixed identities, a hot lingerie catalog photo shoot and a daring heroine all make Double Exposure a completely adorable story that is fun to read and hard to put down!. ~~Mahaira Fatima ~ Just Erotic Romance Reviews_____________________________________________________________Lacy Fitzgerald has made a wager with her father. He will give her money to start up a business, if said business is a success in one year she wins. If the business is in the red and isn't making money she must marry Devin, the man of her father's dreams, not hers. The lingerie business she starts is failing quickly at the six month mark and she needs to pump new blood into the floundering business. That new blood comes in the form of Gabe Wallis, her new model for her lingerie. Sparks fly and steam rises between the two, but is there a future for them or the business?. Lingerie, lust, and one hot male model make for an enjoyable story. Lacy is a character that is easy to identify with. She is strong, confident, and naughty. She knows her mind and sticks with her choices. Her sexual inventiveness is downright outrageous. Gabe is sexy, strong, and has a hint of mystery about him. The sexual chemistry is combustible. The couple faces conflicts that add depth to the story. Plenty of fun with a great amount humor, the story keeps the reader interested. Ms. Scott has a knack for telling a story. I look forward to reading more!"

A summary from the book's Preface:I have no apology to make, and no excuse to offer for writing this book, ""Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days'. It is not the result of vanity, neither is it a desire for notoriety, that prompted me to write it. No, my reasons are higher, and my purposes are nobler. My only desire has been to do good. The religious element runs through the entire story. . It has been a work of faith and a labor of love to me. I cannot express the pleasure I have had in sitting down, and recalling the incidents of my childhood and youth. In doing so, it has enabled me to live my life over again. I only hope that the reader will experience something of the same pleasure in reading the book that I have had in writing it. . The ""Brief Sketches of the Author"" were written just twenty years ago by the late Rev. J. Wofford White. He was a colored man, and a close friend of mine, and was born and reared in the same neighborhood with myself. These sketches were printed in The Christian Witness, a Boston newspaper, and were clipped and carefully pasted in my scrapbook. I republish them in this connection without changing a single word. I would ask the reader to peruse them carefully, and compare them with Chapter XI, entitled ""Little Jimmie, the Mail Boy,"" and note the similarity of characters. . I have written this book because there is no other work in existence just like it. No author, white or colored, so far as I know, has traversed, or attempted to traverse, the literary path which I presume to have trodden in writing this book. We are now about forty-five years away from the last days of slavery and the first days of freedom, and the people who have any personal knowledge of those days are rapidly crossing the mystic river, and entering the land that knows no shadows; and soon, there will not be one left to tell the story. And it is the author's thought that a record of the better life of those days should be left for the good of the future generations of this beautiful southland. Others have written of the evil side of those days, but the author felt it to be his mission to write of the better side. . Before the war, the relation that existed between the master and his slaves was, in most cases, one of tenderness and affection. There was a mutual attachment between them, which has commanded the admiration of the world. But since the war, an estrangement between the colored and the white races has sprung up, which has resulted in a feeling of intense bitterness and alienation. But I am glad to say that things are now taking a turn for the better. I can see signs of a better day ahead ; and if this book should, in any way, contribute to, and help on this much desired day, the author will be satisfied. . Chapters:Brief Sketches of the Author I.

"578E8C99B5294FB2BAA85079D21F93F7",,true,"Universal Mysteries","THIS TRANSLATION HAS BEEN REVISED IN SEPTEMBER 2011!. Universal Mysteries is a fascinating, and in most ways, a unique book. It provides the answers to many intriguing questions about the origin and the nature of the universe, as well as the purpose of humans. It is an ideal read for contemplative minds seeking to understand the scientific basis of spirituality in a comprehensive and concise way.. Over the centuries, Sufism communicated the reality of ‘non-duality.’ It told us what we observe as the world-out-there is in fact a virtual image and the ultimate reality is the Oneness of all that is. This Oneness, that comprises the essence of all things, can only be realized by getting rid of the delusion of being a separate ‘individual.’ . Today, science also claims the same thing; it reports the universe is a giant hologram. As it turns out, this splendid detailed illusion only looks concrete to us because of our brains’ ability to convert a boundless ocean of waves into the projection of what we observe as our physical world. . We are in fact creating this quantum reality at all times, as non-local atoms localize and manifest as physical objects at the sight of a conscious observer. In other words, the apparently material world in which we are living is generated by our very act of observing and interpreting. . This simply means that our universe and everything dwelling in it has two different aspects to its reality. One is the physical world, or the field of cosmic data receptive to our five senses; and the other is the spiritual world, or the dimension of cosmic energy and consciousness that our sensory perception fails to pick up on! In the same way, we can observe ourselves either as physical bodies moving through space and time within the limitations of the five senses. Or we can observe ourselves as masses of wave frequencies within the giant hologram of cosmic energy and consciousness. The former describes a human being having a spiritual experience; the latter describes a spiritual being having a human experience, just like Jem and Alph, the two main characters in “Universal Mysteries”.. The realities of the quantum (or the spiritual) dimension are different when compared to our physical world of limitations but not separate. In the quantum world all things take on a new meaning. If we can consciously allow our minds to transgress beyond this physical life to which we have become accustomed, we will enter a holographic universe. Here, deep within us, is wholeness, a unified field of limitless possibilities in which every cell in our body has the entire knowledge and energy force of the whole universe. In the quantum world, five-sense limitation is obsolete! There are no physical boundaries pertaining to physical bodies or objects anymore! Death is no more a reality than the realities of the five-sense world! The entire universe is a single intelligent system, a unified ‘whole’ of which you and I are an integral part. In fact, there is no ‘you’ and ‘I’, and hence there are no ‘egos; to defend and prove right or ‘individuals’ to protect and comfort. Here, there is only One. Here, is ‘non-duality.’. These are the universal realities Jem is presented by his galactic friend Alph in ‘Universal Mysteries’."

Caught Off Guard is most definitely one of those. Dean and Veronica are two characters that harbored a secret crush for each other all of their lives but didn't necessarily know it. I loved that Dean (picture totally hot, buff firefighter) is so in touch with what he wants. He's dreamed of Veronica for years. Even believing that he had no chance, a tiny spark was always there. Veronica is a woman who has finally taken control of her life. She's straightforward in her attraction to Dean and goes after him with a single-mindedness that is enviable. Their initial meeting when she comes back to town knocked my socks off and the blazing hot attraction between these two continues throughout the book. They both have to examine what they want and decide whether they are ready to try to find happiness together. Although their relationship occurs quickly, it flows well in this fast paced tale and only the wrap up felt rushed. If you're looking for a quick, hot read, then grab Caught Off Guard."" —Trang, Ecataromance 5 Angels: ""Caught Off Guard explodes with passion and longing! Dean and Veronica share some pretty serious fantasies of each other, but as they find out, the reality is definitely better than either could ever have imagined. I really liked Veronica. She was very take-charge and upfront about her desire for Dean, while being equally upfront about her hesitations for a deeper relationship. She didn't hide what she was feeling and thus, though she couldn't always give Dean the answers he wanted, at least he knew that there was hope for a stronger relationship to spark.      Tonya Ramagos has been on my author radar for awhile and this book just cements her place on my keeper shelf.

"D21CFB200AD04AF1B937EE19FC6EF20C",,true,"Zen Culture","“Highly recommended”The Center for Asian Studies. Anyone who examines the Zen arts is immediately struck by how modern they seem. The ceramics of 16th-century Zen artists could be interchanged with the rugged pots of our own contemporary crafts movement; ancient calligraphies suggest the monochromes of Franz Kline or Willem de Kooning; the apparent nonsense and illogic of Zen parables (and No theater and Haiku poetry) established the limitations of language long before the theater of the absurd; 400-year-old Zen architecture seems to be a copy of modern design ideas such as modular space and a California marriage of house and garden.Zen values experiencing things over analyzing them. Perhaps if we can take the power of direct perception, sharpened by the devices of Zen art, back to everyday activities, we will find a beauty in common objects that we previously ignored.. Selected Reviews. The notoriously grumpy Kirkus Reviews said, “Thomas Hoover has a considerable gift for expressing his appreciation and understanding of various arts associated with Zen. . . . These are deftly treated, with a concise synopsis of the historical development of each; and together Hoover’s discussions provide an excellent introduction to the aesthetics of Japanese culture.”. Library Journal said, “Hoover covers the ground in an easy and informative way, describing the origins of Zen itself and the Zen roots of swordsmanship, architecture, food, poetry, drama, ceramics, and many other areas of Japanese life. The book is packed with facts, the bibliography is excellent, the illustrations few but most appropriate, and the style clear and smooth. A most useful book for all collections.”. Asian Studies declared, “Highly recommended. ZEN CULTURE moves easily from the political climate that gave rise to Zen to the cultural areas – art, architecture, theatre, literature, flower arrangement, design, archery, swordsmanship – where Zen has manifested itself.”. As for the influence of the Zen aesthetic, the Houston Chronicle said, “Hoover suggests we need only look around. Modern furniture is clean, simple lines in unstained, unadorned woods. And that old fad became a habit, houseplants. These are all expressions of ideas born with Zen: understatement, asymmetry, intuitive perception, nature worship, disciplined reserve.”. “Highly recommended,” said The Center for Asian Studies.. “Western intellectuals have tried to represent the height of Buddhist mysticism within the pages of mere books, reducing an ineffable experience into a written report. Predictably such attempts have failed miserably. ZEN CULTURE by Thomas Hoover comes the closest to succeeding,” said Hark Publishing. “ZEN CULTURE, concerned as it is with the process of perception as much as with actual works of art, can open our sense so that we experience anew the arts of both East and West, ancient and modern.” declared the Asian Mail.. And to go multi-media, NYC-FM in New York said, “Hoover takes us on a grand tour of Zen archery and swordsmanship, flower arranging, drama, food, gardening, painting, poetry, architecture. His book is essentially one by a connoisseur.”.

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

It is the first of Ray Bradbury's works to be authorized as an ebook.. In the story, Charles Underhill is a widower who will do anything to protect his young son Jim from the horrors of the playground--a playground which he and the boy pass by daily and the tumult of which, the activity, brings back to Charles the anguish of his own childhood. The playground, like childhood itself, is a nightmare of torment and vulnerability; Charles fears his sensitive son will be destroyed there just as he almost was so many years ago.. Underhill's sister Carol, who has moved in to help raise the young boy after his mother passed away, feels differently. The playground, she believes, is preparation for life, Jim will survive the experience she feels, and he will be the better for it and more equipped to deal with the rigor and obligation of adult existence.. Underhill is caught between his own fear and his sister's invocation of reason and feels paralyzed. A mysterious boy calls out to him from the playground, and seems to know all too well why Underhill is there and what the source of his agony really is. A mysterious Manager also lurks to whom the strange boy directs Underhill. An agreement can be made perhaps--this is what the boy tells Underhill. Perhaps Jim can be spared the playground, but of course, a substitute must be found.. ABOUT THE AUTHOR. Ray Bradbury was a rabid and devoted science fiction fan from his early adolescence and from his early years of the Los Angeles Fiction Society. He sold his first story (a collaboration with Henry Haase) to Future Science Fiction when he was only nineteen years old and by the end of the 1940s was one of the most admired science fiction writers. The irony or paradox of Bradbury's career was that it was, at least in his mind, an essential failure. Bradbury's poetic, impressionistic, surreal, and decidedly non-rational stories were deemed unsuitable by John W. Campbell's Astounding science fiction magazine, and virtually all of his early work went to second and third level magazines for publication.. In the postwar years, Bradbury's short stories found home in the so-called mainstream magazines; Mademoiselle, Charm, Redbook, Esquire, and the like, and he became the first science fiction writer to achieve some significant literary recognition through publication in Martha Foley's Best American Short Stories and the O. Henry Prize volumes. Bradbury's first ""novel""--actually a collection of related short stories compiled from work he had published in Planet, Future, and Thrilling Wonder Stories--was published by Doubleday in 1950 and has never been out of print since. It was the basis for both a television feature and a theatrical film.. The collections which followed, “The Illustrated Man” and “A Medicine for Melancholy” among others, were also successful, as was Bradbury's early novel, Something Wicked This Way Comes (also the basis for a Disney film produced in the 1980s). Bradbury collaborated with John Huston in the early 1950s on a film treatment of Moby Dick, and many of his short stories have been the basis for television and theatrical films, notably the feature-length The Wonderful Ice-Cream Suit."

Every nerve ending in her body was buzzing from her glorious orgasm. Devon chuckled and kissed the top of her head before moving onto the bed and cradling her body against his. ""Just pleasant?"" Without saying a word, Con shot up and headed toward the bathroom. Had she done something wrong? He was never quiet, especially after making love. When he reappeared, Tory noticed his gaze went straight to Devon and, unless she was mistaken, Con looked pissed. What was that about? As she sat up, Tory grabbed the sheet and wrapped it around her body. ""Con?"" Con's gaze softened as he stared at the hand she used to clutch the sheet close. ""It's been over two months, baby. You can lose the sheet."" Tory smoothed her palm over the soft, light blue cotton material and said, ""You two might've talked me into sleeping naked, but sitting around in the bright light of day in my birthday suit is never going to happen."" ""We'll see, won't we?"" Devon asked. He moved off the bed and pulled on his pajama pants before moving to sit in the chair he'd vacated earlier. ""Yes, we will."" Always pushing for more, that was Con and Devon, but Tory wasn't budging on this one. Con went to the dresser and opened a drawer. After retrieving a pair of black silk boxers, he slid them on and leaned against the dresser, crossing his legs at the ankles. God, the man was delicious. His close-cropped midnight black hair always tempted Tory to reach out and play. Add a thickly muscled chest and gorgeous six-pack abs to the mix and it was no wonder Tory craved the man. Yep, Con was a silver-eyed hunk, no doubt about it. ""I have something to tell you two,"" he said. ""Now's as good a time as any, I guess."" Tory and Devon looked at each other, then back at Con. ""Shoot,"" Devon said. ""Next Monday is Valentine's Day."" Butterflies flitted around in Tory's stomach at the reminder. Valentine's Day. Crap. She didn't have a clue what she was supposed to get Con and Devon. It was bad enough with one guy to think about. She had two, for crying out loud! ""I'll be honest, I have no idea what I'm getting either of you."" Con winked. ""What you just gave us works for me."" ""Ditto, sugar."""

Alma, the fifth of nine children, was born in 1910 in lower Davidson County, North Carolina—as she says, ""fifteen miles south of Lexington, off number 8 Highway, between Newsom and High Rock, near Jackson Hill and Bald Mountain, in the backwoods of nowhere."" Alma lived with her mama and daddy, who were poor sharecroppers, in a small shack-like house on the edge of the large Reid farm that lay between Cabin Creek and Lick Creek on the Yadkin River.

Through vivid descriptions she leads us through their daily customs folklores and hardships. She speaks of how they had to make do with what they had and how the little that they had was treasured. At age twelve Alma's family left the sharecropping way and moved twenty miles north of the backwoods to Lexington, the county seat. In Lexington her life changed dramatically. First, her one room school was replaced with more modern schools. Then, at a young age she was forced to quit school to help out the family. The biggest change came in her late teens when she met and married Odell Henderson Owen, and in the years that followed, became the mother of eleven children. During the chaotic years of raising eleven children she never forgot her upbringing, how her mama and daddy had instilled in her the importance of family, church and community. Like her daddy, she worked hard, always putting her family's needs first. And in times of personal need, she sought strength through the church .The beauty of this book is in the voice of the book—Alma's voice.

Melina Dmitros is a seasoned battleship captain for the Galactic Alliance. Calls from ships in distress are not all that uncommon in the outermost spirals of the Milky Way. Calls from the warlike Prime were. Now that they were allies, Mel figures she’d better get used to working in conjunction with the chauvinistic race. . She never expected to be attracted to one of them.. The Prime, one of the oldest species in the galaxy, were known for going their own way. But with problems on Cejuru Prime and increasing attacks by the Antareans, the Prime joined the Alliance to lend their expertise in battling the warlike reptilian species--and ultimately, to survive as a race.. Captain Wulf Caradoc, the eldest son and heir apparent of the Prime leader, looked forward to the trip to the Alliance ambassadorial planet. His mission is ostensibly to deliver the diplomatic team to the new Prime embassy. . His real mission is to meet his fated mate, his gemate, one of the Lost Ones.. Wulf hadn’t anticipated the diplomatic mission being attacked by pirates--and he especially hadn’t anticipated his gemate, Melina Dmitros, being the one sent to rescue his ship.. Two strong people pulled together by biology and fate. Their union will be forged in a crucible of survival, treachery and duty.. “The tension between them was phenomenal. The mystery and intrigue about who is behind the resistance and the attempts on Melina’s life added another dimension to an already fabulous story. I can’t wait for the continuation with the storyline and more clues into who is behind the whole resistance. A must read.” - Night Owl Reviews, Top Pick. “The story is very interesting and it reads like a book version of Star Wars movie.” – Mei, Goodreads. The Prime Chronicles (in order):1.

Summers was many things including: a universal flirt, the preeminent scholar of designer shoes, and the ninja master of cussing. With a beauty that was surpassed by her confidence and a confidence surpassed only by her wit, the world was hers to have. But she didn’t want the world. She wanted lots of shoes, lots of adulation and all of Hannes Sighelm.. With a visage and body mocked with scars from fights he was too stubborn or too stupid to back down from, Hannes Sighelm would never be mistaken for handsome. With an attitude that was as fierce as his scarring, he’d also never be mistaken as “personable,” which was good being that he was only a person some of the time. The rest of the time he was in his grizzly form. Built like an armored vehicle in either form, his piercing golden eyes flashed warnings and promised retribution, which is why most everything avoided looking him in the eye…including his brothers.. And then there was Zuri. Not only did she look him in the eyes, she got all up in his personal space when she did it…and dared him to do something about it. As much as Hannes wanted to do something about it, he didn’t. Despite his own needs he liked the feisty and beautiful southerner too much to condemn her to a life with someone like him so reluctantly he walked away. Or at least he tried to. He might’ve been knowledgeable about many subjects but it was clear he had a lot to learn about southern women, especially ones that strutted instead of walked, whose mother tongue was cussing, and one who was determined that Hannes wasn’t going anywhere without her."

His life seems a cruel joke until he meets beautiful, independent Margaret Farnsworth. Margaret, a promised woman, sees only that strong, capable Roy is just the man to guide her through the badlands in search of her brother. . As eastern-bred Margaret struggles to overcome the hardships of the west, Roy’s pleasuring hands and kisses inevitably tear her between two worlds. A marked man, Roy can never give Margaret the respectability she deserves, yet he turns his back on his western code of honor as he dallies with the betrothed beauty. . Excerpt Copyright 2009. Margaret thrust her hands onto her hips and stiffened her back ramrod straight. “Not that it’s any of your business, but my brother sent a telegram to me, asking for my help. He’s in trouble, and sick!” . Margaret felt fear squeeze her heart, and an urgent burning in the pit of her stomach at the thought of her brother suffering somewhere out on this endless prairie. She was driven to see him safe, and if she had to beat off every scoundrel and outlaw in this territory, including this one, well then by God she’d do it. . “Well, that makes me glad I’m not your brother,” Roy scoffed. . “I’m glad, too! My brother wouldn’t smell like cheap perfume!” she lashed back. Margaret was worldly enough to know that western men, like the wild territory, couldn’t be tamed by the mere presence of grace and civility. . Roy winced visibly as he recalled the range-relief gal, the one who’d run her hands over his chest outside the mercantile that afternoon, marking his shirt with her two-bit whore scent. He awkwardly twisted his hat in his hands.. “Where’s home?” he asked abruptly, so as to change the topic of conversation. . “Philadelphia,” she allowed. “I traveled up the Missouri by steamboat, got off at the fort and,” she waved her small hand, “those snakes offered to guide me the rest of the way . . . have you a name?”. Roy chuckled. “My mama, bless her soul, would tan my bottom for forgetting my manners with a lady.” He yanked off his hat, and affected an exaggerated sweeping bow that propelled his thick dark hair forward to frame the hard angles of his face. . “Roy Easton.”. Margaret softened. “Miss Margaret Victoria Taylor Farnsworth.” She extended her hand and smiled. “And thank you for helping me out . . . out of my predicament.” Roy grinned at the woman who hauled a name long enough to need two mules to carry it. He reached to take her smooth white hand, inhaled her intoxicating rose scent, and, feeling a stirring in his groin, he stifled a silent groan. . It was the kind of trouble he didn’t need, especially not now. As his hard cowboy hand met hers in a gentle clasp, he subconsciously registered the fact that she came from the gussied-up stock known as eastern nobility. Sure as steers stampede, those soft-as-silk hands hadn’t known a day of hard work. His rough ones, by contrast, belonged to a hardworking rancher-turned-ex-lawman.. BOOKS IN THE SERIES.

Or, trying to host Thanksgiving in China where holiday staples like turkey and dinner rolls are almost impossible to find. Not every Thanksgiving in America is a folk-art painting. They are as varied as Americans themselves, and run the spectrum of emotion and experience - from as rural as watching Grandma slaughter the holiday bird by the barn, to the traditional with family football games in the yard, and to the modern with multicultural meals complete with eggrolls. . It is a holiday for everyone - regardless of whether arrival to the United States was via the Mayflower, Ellis Island, international airport, or any other way. It is a holiday steeped in traditions (which are either faithfully followed, radically ignored, or adapted to individual circumstances), memories and images. . In Thanksgiving Tales: True Stories of the Holiday in America, 48 writers from across the United States share their individual stories and memories of Thanksgiving and provide insight into the variety of ways the holiday is experienced, celebrated, viewed and cherished by Americans. But, whether held in a country farmhouse, amid the frantic pace of New York City, or in a restaurant, there are a number of common elements. These stories reveal how seemingly simple things- like the passing of a tradition to the next generation, sitting next to Grandpa, favorite foods and recipes, or certain sounds, sights, and smells - can have special meaning and leave warm and indelible memories. . Some of the stories describe the chaos and mishaps of meal preparation, family arguments and first-time hosts - all crises then, but now looked upon with laughter. Other stories recount family traditions, meaningful moments, memorable guests and hosts, remembering those no longer with us, being alone or out-and-out hating the holiday. Thanksgiving Tales is a reflection of Americans, as much as it is a look at the holiday. . It is a testament to the importance of the holiday that Americans will go to great lengths for Thanksgiving - spending money to travel long distances or taking days to prepare meals, sometimes only to find themselves seated next to the weird cousin or sick all night from bacteria-laden food. Yet, it's done all over again the next year."

"F2F194BA778F4F67B4B030A0D1586952",,true,"Life in a Tank","TANKS!To the uninitiated--as were we in those days when we returned to the Somme, too late to see the tanks make their first dramatic entrance--the name conjures up a picture of an iron monster, breathing fire and exhaling bullets and shells, hurling itself against the enemy, unassailable by man and impervious to the most deadly engines of war; sublime, indeed, in its expression of indomitable power and resolution.This picture was one of the two factors which attracted us toward the Heavy Branch Machine-Gun Corps--as the Tank Corps was known in the first year of its being. On the Somme we had seen a derelict tank, wrecked, despoiled of her guns, and forsaken in No Man's Land. We had swarmed around and over her, wild with curiosity, much as the Lilliputians must have swarmed around the prostrate Gulliver. Our imagination was fired.The second factor was, frankly, that we were tired of going over the top as infantrymen. The first time that a man goes into an attack, he as a rule enjoys it. He has no conception of its horrors,--no, not horrors, for war possesses no horrors,--but, rather, he has no knowledge of the sudden realization of the sweetness of life that comes to a man when he is ""up against it."" The first time, it is a splendid, ennobling novelty. And as for the ""show"" itself, in actual practice it is more like a dream which only clarifies several days later, after it is all over. But to do the same thing a second and third and fourth time, is to bring a man face to face with Death in its fullest and most realistic uncertainty. In soldier jargon he ""gets most awful wind up."" It is five minutes before ""Zero Hour."" All preparations are complete. You are waiting for the signal to hop over the parapet. Very probably the Boche knows that you are coming, and is already skimming the sandbags with his machine guns and knocking little pieces of earth and stone into your face. Extraordinary, how maddening is the sting of these harmless little pebbles and bits of dirt! The bullets ricochet away with a peculiar singing hiss, or crack overhead when they go too high. The shells which burst on the other side of the parapet shake the ground with a dull thud and crash. There are two minutes to wait before going over. Then is the time when a man feels a sinking sensation in his stomach; when his hands tremble ever so slightly, and when he offers up a pathetic little prayer to God that if he's a bit of a sportsman he may be spared from death, should his getting through not violate the divine and fatalistic plans. He has that unpleasant lack of knowledge of what comes beyond. For after all, with the most intense belief in the world, it is hard to reconcile the comforting feeling of what one knows with that terrible dread of the unknown.A man has no great and glorious ideas that nothing matters because he is ready to die for his country. He is, of course, ready to die for her. But he does not think about it. He lights a cigarette and tries to be nonchalant, for he knows that his men are watching him, and it is his duty to keep up a front for their sake. Probably, at the same time, they are keeping up a front for him. Then the Sergeant Major comes along, cool and smiling, as if he were out for a stroll at home. Suddenly he is an immense comfort. One forgets that sinking feeling in the stomach and thinks, ""How easy and jolly he is! What a splendid fellow!"" Immediately, one begins unconsciously to imitate him. Then another thinks the same thing about one, and begins to imitate too. So it passes on, down the line. But there is nothing heroic or exalting in going over the top.This, then, was our possible second reason for preferring to attack inside bullet-proof steel; not that death is less likely in a tank, but there seems to be a more sporting chance with a shell than with a bullet."

Izzy Santana and her 13-year-old son Connor move into a Reading Council-provided flat in the sleepy village of Cedham. Locals darkly warn her to stay away from nearby Coombe’s Wood, hinting first at elves, then at multiple murders… which may or may not have taken place in the woods hundreds of years ago. It’s all ludicrously superstitious, and Izzy is so delighted to have found a haven for her son – after being threatened by her sadistic ex-partner George – that she takes little notice. . She meets a neighbour who seems kindly, if a trifle fey, and who takes a great interest in her son. Connor seems instantly comfortable with him. She begins to feel as if she is also falling under his spell. But Connor is bullied at school, and one night she finds herself tracking those bullies in the wood, where she believes they are waiting for him. She doesn’t find them, but something closes in on her – something that sounds like a savage animal. As she runs she realises she may have been set up – or Connor was – to be caught by whatever the animal was. She strengthens the barricades in her flat, no longer puts all the local tales about ‘danger in them woods’ down to superstition, and even begins to wonder about the way she was selected by the Reading Council officer to live in the village in the first place. . Then a slit rabbit turns up on her doorstep, along with a distinctive cigarette butt, and she knows George has found her. Desperately compassionate, her neighbour calls the police, who turn up next day, harumph the ceiling, and take the attitude: You’ve not been attacked, then, Miss? You haven’t actually seen him? Why, if your ex-lover has tracked you down, do you suppose he would he dump a rabbit at your door…? Her own question, more urgent, is: if George can get in the front door of the building, can he get into her flat? . What Izzy needs to do is protect Connor. She has already started to uncover the ancient secrets of the village, and now she works out the perfect way to get rid of George… for good. . Publishers Weekly review 2009In this suspenseful story, strange characters and unnerving legends punctuate one woman’s desperate attempt to flee from her abusive ex-boyfriend by escaping to the English countryside. With little more than an old Toyota and a pair of suitcases, Izzy and her son Connor head to the tiny village of Cedham, where Connor’s father disappeared years before. Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history. Deeply-held Cedham traditions add depth to a familiar set-up and offer the additional mystery of whether these stories could be true—or are they the delusions of a paranoid woman on the run? Nicely done."

Simon began to tease Gabrielle, rippling his fingers over her peaks and valleys with a surety of touch which set her hips thrusting against his hand so desperately, he had all to do not to take her there and then. He whispered against her hair, “If we were alone, do you know what I would do?”She shook her head.“Do you want me to tell you?” he asked, nuzzling her ear and nibbling the lobe.“Mmm,” she sighed through parted lips.“I would lick you all over, running my tongue inside and out. Explore you fully with it, and my fingers, and finally my straining manhood. Penetrate you with all three until you melted against me and called out my name. I would wander over every part of your body, so that you would know my touch everywhere. I’d possess you utterly, so that you could never think of anything but my caresses, my passion. Oh God, Gabrielle, j’ai besoin de toi.”“I need you too, Simon,” she panted, before feasting on his mouth with her own..

This time, the stakes are her trust fund, her freedom, and even her single status. To win, she must take her father's seed money and create a successful lingerie company in one year with no help from any outside sources. Six months into it, out of money and deeply in debt, she hires a handsome hunk to make her catalog sizzle and her sales soar. But far from being a typical lingerie model, there's more to Gabriel Wallace than meets her eyes or her hands. . To My Readers: Double Exposure is a story very dear to my heart. Lacy and Gabe deserve each other, but parental interference threatens their chance at happiness. How many of us have had the same experience? I hope you enjoy reading their story as much as I enjoyed writing it. . Rating: 4/5 Stars! Heat level: H. Launching a lingerie company, Satin and Steel on a limited budget wasn't easy but for Lacy Fitzgerald it is the end of the line. She has to stand up on her feet and make her dear dad realize that he has a sensible daughter who can make effective business deals just like he does. A last minute search for a handsome hunky lingerie model brings her face to face with Gabe Matthews and she feels that his appeal as a rugged construction worker would help her to generate sales. What she doesn't know is that this particular man has lots up his sleeve that would make her fall for him in no time!. Lacy may appear a carefree young woman with only fun on her mind, but really emerges as a responsible person when the need arises. I know I should hate her father for forcing her into earning a living for herself but it turns out that parents really do know more. I never thought that Gabe would be a man to say yes when he doesn't want to but Lacy's charm makes him do things that he never meant to do. I found myself secretly smirking as Lacy's outrageous underwear made Gabe cringe. It really felt like lust at first sight, as the couple never shared their feelings for each other. True, their hot escapades make you hum with excitement but I felt love was lacking somewhere along the line. Sparks from the exciting chemistry that they share had my insides singing in no time. The plot fulfills the demands of a fun contemporary romance and you find yourself pulled in while the couple is trying on raunchy lingerie. Lacy's dear friend, Suzanne Santini is an interesting character and I wouldn't mind meeting her in her own story.. For a debut, Ms. Scott shows real promise and I expect truly dreamy delightful tales from her. Mixed identities, a hot lingerie catalog photo shoot and a daring heroine all make Double Exposure a completely adorable story that is fun to read and hard to put down!. ~~Mahaira Fatima ~ Just Erotic Romance Reviews_____________________________________________________________Lacy Fitzgerald has made a wager with her father. He will give her money to start up a business, if said business is a success in one year she wins. If the business is in the red and isn't making money she must marry Devin, the man of her father's dreams, not hers. The lingerie business she starts is failing quickly at the six month mark and she needs to pump new blood into the floundering business. That new blood comes in the form of Gabe Wallis, her new model for her lingerie. Sparks fly and steam rises between the two, but is there a future for them or the business?. Lingerie, lust, and one hot male model make for an enjoyable story. Lacy is a character that is easy to identify with. She is strong, confident, and naughty. She knows her mind and sticks with her choices. Her sexual inventiveness is downright outrageous. Gabe is sexy, strong, and has a hint of mystery about him. The sexual chemistry is combustible. The couple faces conflicts that add depth to the story. Plenty of fun with a great amount humor, the story keeps the reader interested. Ms. Scott has a knack for telling a story. I look forward to reading more!"

"4686EA83A5A6410185C77BDF6CD6D697",,true,"F. Scott Fitzgerald Collection","""Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940) was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are evocative of the Jazz Age, a term he coined himself. He is widely regarded as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered a member of the ""Lost Generation"" of the Twenties. He finished four novels, including The Great Gatsby, with another published posthumously, and wrote dozens of short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with despair and age. The 1920s proved the most influential decade of Fitzgerald's development.The Great Gatsby, considered his masterpiece, was published in 1925. Fitzgerald made several excursions to Europe, notably Paris and the French Riviera, and became friends with many members of the American expatriate community in Paris, notably Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway looked up to Fitzgerald as an experienced professional writer. Hemingway greatly admired The Great Gatsby and wrote in his A Moveable Feast ""If he could write a book as fine as The Great Gatsby I was sure that he could write an even better one"" (153). Hemingway expressed his deep admiration for Fitzgerald, and Fitzgerald's flawed, self-defeating character, when he prefaced his chapters concerning Fitzgerald in A Moveable Feast with: His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred. Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and their construction and he learned to think and could not fly any more because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it had been effortless. (129) Much of what Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast helped to establish the myth of Fitzgerald's dissipation and loss (of ability, social control, and life) and Zelda's hand in that demise. Though the bulk of Hemingway's text is factually correct, it is also colored by his disappointment in Fitzgerald, as well as Hemingway's own rivalrous response towards any competitor, living or dead. That disappointment was most evident in The Green Hills of Africa, where he specifically mentions Fitzgerald as an archetypal ruined American writer; Hemingway had been both shocked and unnerved by Fitzgerald's account of his own difficulties in his nonfiction essays and notebooks from the 1930s, published as The Crack-Up (with Edmund Wilson as editor) in 1945. Fitzgerald’s friendship with Hemingway was quite vigorous and as many of Fitzgerald’s relationships would prove to be. (As, indeed, were many of the thrice-divorced Hemingway's.) Hemingway did not get on well with Zelda, either. He claimed that she “encouraged her husband to drink so as to distract Scott from his ‘real’ work on his novel,"" the other work being the short stories he sold to magazines. This “whoring”, as Fitzgerald, and subsequently Hemingway, called these sales, was a sore point in the authors’ friendship. Fitzgerald claimed that he would first write his stories in an authentic manner but then put in “twists that made them into saleable magazine stories.” "" Wikipedia."

Age-old questions that just about every one asks. True Stories of Messages From Beyond tells 14 different personal stories of the bond we all share with those we love a bond never broken, not even by death.

Each encounter, whether a smell, a touch, a message in a song or another form of communication are touching, emotional and give hope to those who read them. . Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul.. I finally got out of bed about 6:30 a.m. and started getting ready to go to the airport. I did everything I possibly could to keep back the tears. Packing my suitcase was so hard. I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

It came by claymore and cannon fire in 1745, when Bonnie Prince Charlie's men died at Culloden, and the last Stuart fled back to France, leaving his followers to death by noose and firing squad, and his gold hidden in the heather for others to find. After a thousand years of bloody history, death in the Highlands is nothing new. But it should not be happening now.. Jean Fairbairn has a coin from Prince Charlie's hoard, and a story, she thinks. Until the story comes to murder, up close and personal, and Jean isn't just a reporter, she's a prime suspect. Nose to nose with Chief Inspector Alasdair Cameron, whose forebears led Charlie's rising, and Rick MacLyon, who thinks being a dot.com millionaire makes him an expert on Charlie's life, Jean finds herself entangled in a story that's getting grimmer than the Dark Mile by Loch Arkaig and twistier than Stuart politics. And it's all too likely to end with Jean trapped by a murderer, on her way to becoming the MacLyon mansion's newest ghost.. Mystery, history and sexual tension blend with a taste of the wild beauty of the Highlands: an enjoyable tale. Kirkus Reviews. In pursuit of information about Bonnie Prince Charlie's legendary lost gold, reporter Jean Fairbairn discovers a new corpse instead. Before all is said and done, she tangles with a nouveau-riche Stuart aficionado and Inspector Cameron. An entertaining blend of policing and sleuthing. . Library Journal Carl's skillful story telling, Scotland's history, and the discussion of how conspiracy theories and genealogies effect the past and the present make The Secret Portrait a mystery worth reading. Her story and her characters had me reading every spare moment I had. MacLyon's conspiracy theory moments had me laughing out loud. She had me guessing until the end. Christine McCreedy, Christine's Book-list. An excellent book with a bit of woo-woo and a lot of painlessly delivered culture and history. Throw in a gold coin from the Bonnie Prince Charlie’s missing horde and a couple of men who look fine in kilts, a dash of bagpipes, and descriptions of Edinburgh so vivid you can almost taste the haggis and you have a most enjoyable read.. Shirley Wetzel, Over My Dead Body.com. The Secret Portrait is a terrific tale that mixes Scottish lore and legend with murder, madness and the paranormal. The author's characters are richly drawn and authentic. Jean’s natural curiosity from academic research makes her the perfect amateur sleuth. The pacing is perfect for an entertaining read. The dialog is sharp and witty. Roberta Austin, Murder and Mayhem Book Club. As always, Lillian Stewart Carl crafts an exceptionally well-written and tightly plotted tale. And as always, her characters draw you into her stories until you find yourself standing in Jean's shoes on the staircase of Glendessary House while ghostly footsteps clump closer and closer. Engaging, absorbing, rousingly good and finally -- highly recommended. I very much look forward to more adventures with Jean and Alasdair. . Teri Smith, Crescent Blues Book Review"

Through vivid descriptions she leads us through their daily customs folklores and hardships. She speaks of how they had to make do with what they had and how the little that they had was treasured. At age twelve Alma's family left the sharecropping way and moved twenty miles north of the backwoods to Lexington, the county seat. In Lexington her life changed dramatically. First, her one room school was replaced with more modern schools. Then, at a young age she was forced to quit school to help out the family.

And in times of personal need, she sought strength through the church .The beauty of this book is in the voice of the book—Alma's voice.
