Now that he’s dated the entire female population of the school and made bitter ex-girlfriends of them all, where is he to look for the occasional bout of casual sex? . As fate would have it, Yuichi and Kanae have become fast friends, and the entire school is talking. What in the world is the Cool Beauty doing with the school jerk? Yuichi and Kanae aren’t talking, not that words are necessary anyway—these boys speak the language of the body, so this rumor might not be false after all! . Aki Morimoto’s sultry novel follows the stories of Kanae and Yuichi, both social outsiders looking for someone to please them sexually as well as accept them for their true selves. As their relationship grows, will they remember to open up and understand one another? Or will words go unspoken in favor of the pursuit of bodily pleasure?"

Many – politicians and media and citizens alike – seem to assume that the main goal of government is to ensure that the economy is forever moving forward. It is now overwhelmingly clear however, says Nic Marks in this essay, that the blind pursuit of economic growth has created a whole set of social and environmental issues that are rapidly undermining the potential happiness and well-being of current and future generations. He convincingly posits and argues that it's time to imagine a different future, one where the desired outcome of policies and governance is the quality of people's experience of life.. The founder of the Centre for Well-Being, an independent think tank at the new economics foundation (nep) in London, Marks has written here a powerful story about how, by measuring the wrong things, such as GDP, we have headed in the wrong direction, and offers strong suggestions on how nations and people can return to a shared common purpose: nurturing well-being. Though it does suggest a radical new approach to policymaking and a set of specific and positive actions, this is not a traditional political manifesto. Marks' argument is steeped in rigorous statistical methods to measure happiness, analyzing and interpreting the evidence so that it can be applied to such policy fields as education, sustainable development, healthcare, and economics."

A rogue nation decides to take advantage of the chaos at this time to attack America with nuclear weapons. The American intelligence network learns of the plan and the government decides to launch a first strike at this rogue nation. This information leaks out to other nations and soon the world is poised on the brink of all out nuclear conflagration as the nuclear nations choose sides in the coming conflict. As the militaries of the world go underground in preparation for the attack most of the world is blissfully ignorant of what is about to happen. There are a few exceptions to this. The civilians that are aware make plans to try to survive the attack as well. As the moment for the attack draws near, the disaster plagued planet is beset by earthquakes of unprecedented intensity and numbers. Oddly the epicenters seem to be located at every major military installation around the world.

When the survivors of the earthquakes look around them the next morning they see a world drastically changed. A few men and women struggle to cope with the devastation as best they can but many turn to marauding as a means of survival.

REVIEW for Devil's Pact""Devin Spawn is an outlaw. Given away at birth by his father, Devin travels to his father's ranch to find out why. When he gets close, he comes across a tiny, beautiful woman bathing in the river. Since he has the devil inside of him, Devin does the one thing that comes natural to him--he seduces and makes her his own. There is one thing Devin doesn't know. He has just had relations with his stepmother. Megan Spawn has had a tough life. Rescued from a life of drudgery by her now deceased husband, she wants to spend her life caring for her stepdaughters and possibly being able to have a relationship with the town doctor, her first love, Caleb Walker. That is, until she is touched by the outlaw known as Devil's Spawn. Caleb Walker has loved Megan ever since she was a little girl. When his family caught them in the barn when they were teenagers and sent him away, Caleb has despaired of ever being able to be with Megan. He loves her and is willing to give her time. However, with the arrival of Devin Spawn, time may be running out because it seems that no matter how much Caleb loves her, she might not be his for the taking. Megan and Devin enter into a carnal relationship like none before. Their coming together is sensual and passionate. It is harsh and bold. But where does Caleb fit into this equation? Caleb and Devin enter into a pact, a pact where Caleb becomes part of the pair to make a triad. While Devil's Pact wasn't the tender and enchanting menage that I have grown used to reading, it still engrossed me cover to cover, and with the book being over 180,000 words, that is saying quite a lot. In all honesty, I didn't put it down. Samantha Cruise has written a menage unlike any I have read and I plan to read anything else she releases. She caught my attention with Devil's Pact and I think she will hold it for a long time."" --Talia Ricci, Joyfully Reviewed"

Now if only she can keep her father from mounting Jason’s head on a wall…Jason is all man on the surface, but wolf shifter down to the bone. He’s more than ready to stop “playing the pack” and find his one true mate, and Sydney of the luscious curves is the woman of his dreams. Finding out that she comes from a family sworn to eradicate his kind isn’t a deal-breaker. But her outrageous plan for him to masquerade as the wolf in hunter’s clothing, right under her father’s very nose, could be asking more than he ever expected to give.This book was previously published in ebook form only under the title Kissin’ in the Moonlight, and has been revised from its original release."

But neither are you old, or even what you think of as middle-aged. You are no longer what you were, but not quite sure what you are.  . Stephanie Dolgoff calls this stage of a woman’s life “Formerly,” the state of mind and body she herself is in now: Her roaring twenties are behind her, but she’s not in hot flash territory, either.

From fashion to friendship, beauty to body image, married sex to single searching, mothering to careering (or both), Dolgoff reveals the upside to not being forever 21—even as you watch the things you once thought were so essential to a happy life go the way of the cassette tape. You may be formerly thin, formerly cool, formerly (seemingly) carefree, formerly cutting-edge, but in reading My Formerly Hot Life you are reminded that you are finally more comfortable in your skin (formerly obsessed with your weight), finally following your instincts (formerly ruled by the opinions of others), and finally happy with where you are (formerly focused on the guy or job you thought would take you where you thought you should be). While you may no longer be as close to the media-machine-generated idea of fabulous, you can do many, many more things fabulously..

Jet-powered aircraft streaked toward specified targets, cannons roared, tanks lumbered, men fought and died, women wept, and children cried. The Holy Land, once the personal province of the Prince of Peace, was engulfed by war.This troubled land has witnessed much conflict throughout its history; its peoples have suffered terrible trials and tribulations. No single battle is better remembered, however, than occurred in the Valley of Elah during the year 1063 B.C. Along the mountains on one side, the feared armies of the Philistines were marshalled to march directly to the heart of Judah and the Jordan Valley. On the other side of the valley, King Saul had drawn up his armies in opposition.Historians tell us that the opposing forces were about evenly matched in number and in skill. However, the Philistines had managed to keep secret their valued knowledge of smelting and fashioning iron into formidable weapons of war. The sound of hammers pounding upon anvils and the sight of smoke rising skyward from many bellows as the smiths went about the task of sharpening weapons and fashioning new ones must have struck fear into the hearts of Saul's warriors, for even the most novice of soldiers could know the superiority of iron weapons to those of brass.As often happened when armies faced each other, individual champions challenged others from the opposing forces to single combat. There was considerable precedent for this sort of fighting; and on more than one occasion, notably during the tenure of Samson as judge, battles had been decided by individual combat.Now, however, the situation was reversed as far as Israel was concerned, and it was a Philistine who dared to challenge all others-a veritable giant of a man called Goliath of Gath. Old accounts tell us that Goliath was ten feet tall. He wore brass armor and a coat of mail. And the staff of his spear would stagger a strong man merely to lift, let alone hurl. His shield was the longest ever seen or heard of, and his sword a fearsome blade."

""This blending of two major Victorian characters is written in a style so seamless you can almost believe it was found in the attic of one of Doyle’s editors. Yes, it’s a little darker than I usually read, but I honestly couldn’t put it down. The nuances of Holmes, Watson, and yes, Count Vlad Dracula himself are layered and well-drawn. You’ll hold your breath, I promise. It’s quite simply the most believable Holmes/fantasy crossover I’ve ever read."" - from STEAMED! @ http://ageofsteam.wordpress.com. ""What's most remarkable about this story is the degree of authenticity Klaver gives it-- it reads just like a story by Doyle (or Watson, if you prefer!). The attention to Victorian detail is also noteworthy, and it's clear that the author knows his Holmes mythology. You may think you've seen all that can be done with teh sub-genre of ""Holmes meets Dracula"" tales, but The Case of the Solitary Grave is exciting and refreshingly unpredictable. As a bonus, we get a very touching look at the deep bond of friendship between Holmes and Watson."" - Heath Lowrance. ""I was very pleased with this short story. I am a big fan of the original Sherlock Holmes stories and of the novel Dracula. This short story was well written and was strikingly similar to the style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself.

Adding to the excitement is that the audience will wonder whether the terror is an evil supernatural creature or an amoral human…Aiden James provides a dark thriller that grips fans from the opening.”—Harriet Klausner, Amazon’s #1 book reviewer for THE FORGOTTEN EDEN. “Aiden James writing style flows very easily and I found that CADES COVE snowballed into a very gripping tale. Clearly the strengths in the piece were as the spirit's interaction became prevalent with the family… The Indian lore and ceremonies and the flashbacks to Allie Mae's (earthly) demise were very powerful. I think those aspects separated the work from what we've seen before in horror and ghost tales.”—Evelyn Klebert, author of A GHOST OF A CHANCE and DRAGONFLIES. “Aiden James is insanely talented!”—J.R.

"6B6AB2E74E5E4E878A9920D21565BD99",,true,"Universal Mysteries","THIS TRANSLATION HAS BEEN REVISED IN SEPTEMBER 2011!. Universal Mysteries is a fascinating, and in most ways, a unique book. It provides the answers to many intriguing questions about the origin and the nature of the universe, as well as the purpose of humans. It is an ideal read for contemplative minds seeking to understand the scientific basis of spirituality in a comprehensive and concise way.. Over the centuries, Sufism communicated the reality of ‘non-duality.’ It told us what we observe as the world-out-there is in fact a virtual image and the ultimate reality is the Oneness of all that is. This Oneness, that comprises the essence of all things, can only be realized by getting rid of the delusion of being a separate ‘individual.’ . Today, science also claims the same thing; it reports the universe is a giant hologram. As it turns out, this splendid detailed illusion only looks concrete to us because of our brains’ ability to convert a boundless ocean of waves into the projection of what we observe as our physical world. . We are in fact creating this quantum reality at all times, as non-local atoms localize and manifest as physical objects at the sight of a conscious observer. In other words, the apparently material world in which we are living is generated by our very act of observing and interpreting. . This simply means that our universe and everything dwelling in it has two different aspects to its reality. One is the physical world, or the field of cosmic data receptive to our five senses; and the other is the spiritual world, or the dimension of cosmic energy and consciousness that our sensory perception fails to pick up on! In the same way, we can observe ourselves either as physical bodies moving through space and time within the limitations of the five senses. Or we can observe ourselves as masses of wave frequencies within the giant hologram of cosmic energy and consciousness. The former describes a human being having a spiritual experience; the latter describes a spiritual being having a human experience, just like Jem and Alph, the two main characters in “Universal Mysteries”.. The realities of the quantum (or the spiritual) dimension are different when compared to our physical world of limitations but not separate. In the quantum world all things take on a new meaning. If we can consciously allow our minds to transgress beyond this physical life to which we have become accustomed, we will enter a holographic universe. Here, deep within us, is wholeness, a unified field of limitless possibilities in which every cell in our body has the entire knowledge and energy force of the whole universe. In the quantum world, five-sense limitation is obsolete! There are no physical boundaries pertaining to physical bodies or objects anymore! Death is no more a reality than the realities of the five-sense world! The entire universe is a single intelligent system, a unified ‘whole’ of which you and I are an integral part. In fact, there is no ‘you’ and ‘I’, and hence there are no ‘egos; to defend and prove right or ‘individuals’ to protect and comfort. Here, there is only One. Here, is ‘non-duality.’. These are the universal realities Jem is presented by his galactic friend Alph in ‘Universal Mysteries’."

Yet none of these tribes has held sway since a mysterious Warlord and his legion of alien mercenaries seized power and began a fifty-year reign of terror.. Now, at last, the tide may be turning: the leaders of the warring Eickarie factions have forged an alliance—strong enough to capture a city and corner the Warlord and his minions in their fortress.

Once infamously known as “Vader’s Fist,” the legendary 501st are the best men for the dangerous objective at hand—capturing the Warlord alive. It’s a risky mission that might be jeopardized when Imperial unit commander Twister and his comrades, Shadow, Cloud, and Watchman, are waylaid by a band of zealous freedom fighters, armed with their own agenda . . . and plenty of firepower.

Maybe it’s karma, but sparks of frustration turn into the heat of attraction and within the week the pair are involved in an interracial romance with plenty of explicit sex. . But just when things start really heating up, cruel fate steps in at Christmas vacation, when, after a second snafu, the lovebirds are separated the by an ocean of despair—the Atlantic Ocean. . EXCERPTWhen we got back to our room, Rene headed to one of the baths we would be sharing with three other students, while I simply threw on a nightshirt and hopped in bed. I just lay there and reflected on what Tami said. I'd naively thought I had my future at Juilliard mapped out. Rene would be my roommate and best friend for this year. For the next three years since the dorms were mostly for freshmen, I figured we could share an inexpensive two bedroom, New York flat. I wasn't naive, I knew those seven words, an inexpensive two bedroom, New York flat, created an oxymoron, but I'm an optimist.. In the middle of my contemplation, Rene returned. His hair, now darkened and damp, hung uncombed, but that wasn't what caught my attention. The only thing that kept him from standing naked before me was a white towel wrapped around and tucked in his waist.. He smiled. ""Turn your head, ma chere, while I put my pajamas bottoms on."". I did, but I snuck a peek. My mouth watered as he turned his backside to me and dropped the towel. His broad shoulders and muscular chest veed into a narrow waist and ultra-sexy taut buns and that wasn't all. One at a time, he lifted a foot into each pajama leg, his shoulder muscles rippling, but before he pulled them up into place, every ounce of oxygen in my lungs exhaled and my pussy muscles clenched. From betwixt his muscular legs, the underside of his sex, the tip of his penis and his pinkish mauve scrotum, beckoned to me and I couldn't catch my breath. Finally when I thought I would pass out from oxygen deprivation, I gasped a breath of life.. Rene swung around, concern etched on his beautiful face. ""Are you all right?"". My eyelids rose and I gasped again as blood rushed to my clit and pussy. His long, thick male member dangled from the opening in his pajamas.. He looked down and quickly inserted himself. ""Sorry,"" he uttered, but the damage had been done.. The damage, of course, was to my idyllic concept of how we could be platonic friends and roommates for the next four years. ""Girl, you're going to be the horniest dancer in Juilliard. And what about him? Is he supposed to go without for four years?"" What Tami had been trying to tell me slammed into my mind like a head on collision. Why hadn't this been a problem last night? Because, you idiot, you both fell asleep in your clothes after talking half the night.. He smiled. ""Are you going to sleep?"". ""If I can."". ""Would it bother you if I did some things on my computer?"". Apparently on the way to losing my mind, I blurted out, ""This wouldn't be a problem if you weren't so God damned good looking,"" and rolled over to face the wall.. ""What?"". My head turned back part way. ""Never mind, forget I said that."". The mattress sank behind me and then a tender stroke brushed my arm. ""No, mon amour, what is bothering you?"". I turned back over onto my back and raised up on my elbows. ""I'm sorry, I'm so mixed up right now, it's driving me crazy."". SUB-GENRES INCLUDED Erotic RomanceBWWMRomance and SexBDSM"

It isn't wise to mess with a girl and her dragon, at least not these two. . A young dragon, named Crimzariathon, loses his mother to lair raiders and is left to fend for himself. A lucky girl, aptly named Clover, happens upon him and together they form a lasting bond. When more men come to raid the lair the two are forced to defend themselves, and each other, in a wicked battle. Magic, swordplay, and dragon riding glory await in this satisfying 25 page short story. . Snippet:The cool night air rushed over them as they circled slowly upward on Crimzon's strong, steady thrusts. In the dragon's head his mother's soft voice whispered both instruction and encouragement, and the feeling of Clover on his back gave him the confidence and reassurance he needed to avoid falter. They climbed so high into the sky that Clover thought she just might be able to touch the stars twinkling above them. Her blood was electric with sensation. Her skin was chilled by the rushing air and her stomach was tingling as if full of wiggling snakes. She drew in a deep breath trying to calm herself but it was no use. Just as soon as she exhaled Crimzon rolled to the right and then dove sharply, leaving the wiggling snakes from Clover's belly lumped in the back of her throat. Her mind was spinning like a whirlpool. Far below, the majesty of the moonlit valleys and the hue of colors reflecting from the rocky snow-capped ridges unfolded before them. Clover marveled at the dozens of rivers and streams that glittered like strands and pools of molten gold. The force of the air pressed hard against her as Crimzon dove. She began to feel dizzy and distant, but before she slipped into unconsciousness, the dragon leveled out and sped them across the treetops at such speed that all Clover could see below was a shadowy blur. Soon their momentum died away and Crimzon began to circle and rise again, but now at a more relaxed pace. Clover was glad. She felt rubbery and nauseated. Sick or not she had to admit that it was the most exhilarating experience she had ever had. Also available: Crimzon & Clover II - The Tricky Wizard. A flash fiction short story called 'The Blood of Coldfrost' and a short preview of 'The Royal Dragoneers' novel are included in this download as well."

Dennis passed away in a hospital bed in the bedroom we shared. I was with him, holding his hand, when he peacefully passed. My best friend was the first person to arrive at my house and she made all of the necessary calls for me. I remained in the room with Dennis, not able to leave his side. My friend had stepped outside for a few minutes and then the excitement began. Suddenly, everyone was calling for me to come outside. I replied that I didn't want to leave Dennis. The hospice nurse then came into the room and told me that I would forever regret not going outside. When I got outside, many of my neighbors were lining my street to see this amazing thing happening.. The day of the visitation was here. It was the day I dreaded the most. Today I would have to see my daughter in a casket. I asked God to help me get through this day. He did. The funeral director gently opened the lid and we stepped forward. The next twenty minutes were a total blur. There was my girl. She looked beautiful. Only a small bruise on the bridge of her nose gave a clue to the trauma her body had undergone. It was as though time stood still. I began to cry as I have never cried before. It was a deep guttural cry that came from deep within my soul.. I finally got out of bed about 6:30 a.m. and started getting ready to go to the airport. I did everything I possibly could to keep back the tears. Packing my suitcase was so hard. I walked down the stairs and my mom was sitting on the couch looking just as disappointed as I was. I cried hugging her and holding her, telling her I would be back in a few weeks: I promise Mom! I kept telling her, Don t worry I ll be back! I loaded the car, and pulled out of the driveway knowing that was the last time I would see my mom standing in the door waving goodbye to me. She was crying too. We both knew, this was it; if I made it back in a few weeks, everything would be different. I never cried so hard in my life. I believe that leaving that morning was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. I had to go, with my mom standing there alive, still able to communicate, and I wouldn't ever get to see her like that again..

Her new business—a shop of sexual favors and lingerie—is sure to give her some of that, but it’s the prospect of Dean Wolcott that really lights the fire inside her.   Genre: Erotic Contemporary [contains graphic sexual content and adult language] Length: Novel (41,000 words) 5 Stars, 2006 Reviewers' Choice Award Nominee: ""Tonya Ramagos is an author who never fails to tell a great story. Caught Off Guard is most definitely one of those. Dean and Veronica are two characters that harbored a secret crush for each other all of their lives but didn't necessarily know it. I loved that Dean (picture totally hot, buff firefighter) is so in touch with what he wants. He's dreamed of Veronica for years. Even believing that he had no chance, a tiny spark was always there. Veronica is a woman who has finally taken control of her life. She's straightforward in her attraction to Dean and goes after him with a single-mindedness that is enviable. Their initial meeting when she comes back to town knocked my socks off and the blazing hot attraction between these two continues throughout the book. They both have to examine what they want and decide whether they are ready to try to find happiness together. Although their relationship occurs quickly, it flows well in this fast paced tale and only the wrap up felt rushed. If you're looking for a quick, hot read, then grab Caught Off Guard."" —Trang, Ecataromance 5 Angels: ""Caught Off Guard explodes with passion and longing! Dean and Veronica share some pretty serious fantasies of each other, but as they find out, the reality is definitely better than either could ever have imagined. I really liked Veronica. She was very take-charge and upfront about her desire for Dean, while being equally upfront about her hesitations for a deeper relationship. She didn't hide what she was feeling and thus, though she couldn't always give Dean the answers he wanted, at least he knew that there was hope for a stronger relationship to spark.      Tonya Ramagos has been on my author radar for awhile and this book just cements her place on my keeper shelf. Perhaps a simple romance plot-wise, the emotional intensity of these characters marks this story as a winner. I hope Ms. Ramagos has plans to write about the other firefighters of Silver Springs."" —Sarah W., Fallen Angel Reviews5 Cups: ""What is hotter than a fireman love story? How about a mature woman that is ready to embrace her sensual side? This book hooked me from the very first page. This story draws you in with the action and the layers of details. I have to say that I loved reading it and hope you do too."" —Missy, Coffee Time Romance"

Even his letters have stopped. With no news and no idea what has happened to him, Miranda goes on a search for her missing husband, accompanied only by a stray cat. On reaching her husband’s last known location, she finds the local authorities uninterested in helping to find him. Worse, some of the local citizens suspect Miranda of using magic, a treasonous offense, because of the unusual cat that has followed her on her quest. Although Miranda has always believed that magic is superstitious nonsense, she finds the circumstances of her beloved husband’s disappearance growing more and more mysterious.....

In a well-built fantasy world with a distinctly Victorian flavor, a woman's husband mysteriously disappears. . .she sets out in search of him. . .having more than her share of adventures along the way. —Roland Green, Booklist . Taylor sets this low-key fantasy in a world where magic is officially denied despite hints of its continued existence.

The fast pace, good characterization, and hint of the outcome keep readers rapidly turning the pages. A great choice for a quick read or an introduction to fantasy. –School Library Journal. A lighthouse keeper’s wife decides to look for her missing husband. Her search takes her to a distant city where she’s seen as a country bumpkin, but her sincere (and somewhat naive) determination carries her though dead ends and suspiciously unhelpful bureaucrats. Her only comfort from home is a stray cat that insists on accompanying her. But the title really refers to a different cat’s paw: Miranda is being used as a pawn in a dangerous game of intrigue, murder, and rumors of magic, which she regards as strictly superstition—at least at first. –Carolyn Cushman, Locus"

""This blending of two major Victorian characters is written in a style so seamless you can almost believe it was found in the attic of one of Doyle’s editors. Yes, it’s a little darker than I usually read, but I honestly couldn’t put it down. The nuances of Holmes, Watson, and yes, Count Vlad Dracula himself are layered and well-drawn. You’ll hold your breath, I promise. It’s quite simply the most believable Holmes/fantasy crossover I’ve ever read."" - from STEAMED! @ http://ageofsteam.wordpress.com. ""What's most remarkable about this story is the degree of authenticity Klaver gives it-- it reads just like a story by Doyle (or Watson, if you prefer!). The attention to Victorian detail is also noteworthy, and it's clear that the author knows his Holmes mythology. You may think you've seen all that can be done with teh sub-genre of ""Holmes meets Dracula"" tales, but The Case of the Solitary Grave is exciting and refreshingly unpredictable. As a bonus, we get a very touching look at the deep bond of friendship between Holmes and Watson."" - Heath Lowrance. ""I was very pleased with this short story. I am a big fan of the original Sherlock Holmes stories and of the novel Dracula. This short story was well written and was strikingly similar to the style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself.

Alma, the fifth of nine children, was born in 1910 in lower Davidson County, North Carolina—as she says, ""fifteen miles south of Lexington, off number 8 Highway, between Newsom and High Rock, near Jackson Hill and Bald Mountain, in the backwoods of nowhere."" Alma lived with her mama and daddy, who were poor sharecroppers, in a small shack-like house on the edge of the large Reid farm that lay between Cabin Creek and Lick Creek on the Yadkin River. In her own words, Alma resurrects now forgotten times and places as she shares with us the everyday trials of life as a sharecroppers in the early 1900s. Through vivid descriptions she leads us through their daily customs folklores and hardships. She speaks of how they had to make do with what they had and how the little that they had was treasured. At age twelve Alma's family left the sharecropping way and moved twenty miles north of the backwoods to Lexington, the county seat. In Lexington her life changed dramatically. First, her one room school was replaced with more modern schools. Then, at a young age she was forced to quit school to help out the family. The biggest change came in her late teens when she met and married Odell Henderson Owen, and in the years that followed, became the mother of eleven children. During the chaotic years of raising eleven children she never forgot her upbringing, how her mama and daddy had instilled in her the importance of family, church and community. Like her daddy, she worked hard, always putting her family's needs first. And in times of personal need, she sought strength through the church .The beauty of this book is in the voice of the book—Alma's voice. Alma tells her story with a warmth that leaves you laughing at times and at other times holding a tissue to your eyes."

The intrepid American heroine of WALKING INTO MURDER, professor Laura Morland, would have scoffed at the idea. All she wanted was a few days of peace to recover from a humiliating (if not entirely unwelcome) divorce and a chance to test her new independence. That she certainly does; peace is another matter.. WALKING INTO MURDER is a light-hearted mystery with a delightful setting, an intriguing plot and distinctive characters headed by Laura Morland, a wonderfully appealing new amateur detective. It is part traditional English mystery, part middle-aged female sleuth of independent spirit who solves mysteries that confound the experts, part primer on the the battle between the sexes since Laura is an expert on gender, part rousing adventure. Laura is hardly Miss Marple - she is younger, more active, attractive, even romantically inclined, but the settings and characters are very British indeed. . It's a wonderful read: spine-tingling escapes and confrontations on deserted moors contrast with peaceful interludes in England's quaintest villages and most verdant countryside - and with some near-comic scenes of Laura's inept but ultimately successful efforts to track down the villains even as she eludes their clutches. Mask-making, amateur theatrics, underground tunnels and an escape from a boarded-up cottage are all part of the action. The adventure begins when Laura is invited to teach a seminar on gender issues in London. First she decides to embark on a solo walking trip on the Cotswold Way. The walk soon takes stormy turns. A man plummets out of the thick mist, hauls her into an embrace and begs her to masquerade as his wife. Escorted at gunpoint by an aristocratic Englishman to an ancient manor house, she is confronted by a roomful of eccentrics, any of whom could be the killer of the body she finds in a bedroom - a body that perversely keeps changing its identity. In fact, everyone in in this bizarre household seems to have multiple identities and multiple motivations, making it exceedingly difficult to determine who is telling the truth and even harder to ascertain who is on Laura's side.. Curiosity is Laura's dominant trait and she delves into the mystery with possibly unwise abandon. She is determined to unmask the murderer - and to get the best of her alternately charming and irritating would-be husband, to whom she is undeniably attracted. She soon discovers that her fund of scholarly knowledge about male/female relationships is of little help in dealing with a man who refuses to answer her questions, appears to be having a steamy affair with the titled Lady of the house, and who increasingly seems the most likely candidate for murderer. Complicating matters further is his fraught relationship with Laura's able assistant in crime-detection, a fiery, free-spirited runaway who lives in the woods.. As Laura probes deeper, the efforts of the villains to silence her become more frantic and her strategies to evade them more ingenious. With total disregard for the escalating danger, she vows to outwit them all. And she does. In a final dramatic - and totally unexpected - scene, she zeroes in on the killer, or it might be more accurate to say the murderer zeroes in on her.. Joan Dahr Lambert is the author of CIRCLES OF STONE, a prehistoric novel told through the eyes of three women who became leaders of their tribes, and published by Simon & Schuster in 1997 & 1999. Lambert has written two other prehistoric novels, a novel about wolves for children and a novella, as well as the first two books in the Laura Morland series. The second, BABES IN THE BATHS, will be out soon. Like may published authors, she has decided to try self-publishing. All of her books will soon appear on Kindle and on other on-line venues."

""If the conquest of a great peak brings moments of exultation and bliss, which in the monotonous, materialistic existence of modern times nothing else can approach, it also presents great dangers. It is not the goal of grand alpinism to face peril, but it is one of the tests one must undergo to deserve the joy of rising for an instant above the state of crawling grubs."" Lionel Terray, 1965.

Feeling the turbulent air of the thermals boiling off the sun-baked landscape, he instinctively banked into the uplifting arms of the air column and was pulled skyward toward the roof of the world.

An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: A True Story (also called the Red Book).. The Bell Witch or Bell Witch Haunting is a poltergeist legend from Southern United States folklore, involving the Bell family of Adams, Tennessee. The legend is the basis of the films An American Haunting (2006) and The Bell Witch Haunting (2004), and may have influenced the production of The Blair Witch Project (1999).. According to the legend, the first manifestation of the haunting occurred in 1817 when John William Bell, Sr. encountered a strange animal in a cornfield on his large farm in Robertson County, on the Red River, near Adams, Tennessee.. This incident was quickly followed by a series of strange beating and gnawing noises manifesting outside and eventually inside the Bell residence. Betsy Bell, the family's younger daughter claimed to have been assaulted by an invisible force.. Some people believe that the spirit returned in 1935, the year when the witch claimed it would return (""one hundred years and seven"" past 1828), and took up residence on the former Bell property. . The most famous account is recorded in what has come to be called the Red Book, the 1894 An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch of Tennessee by Martin Van Buren Ingram, which cites the earlier Richard William Bell's Diary: Our Family Trouble. Richard Williams Bell lists several witnesses, including General (later President) Andrew Jackson. . That account and also an account of a related incident, The Mississippi Bell Witch account are included in this volume. Bell Witch legends are almost as prevalent in Mississippi as they are in Tennessee because of the fact that the families of two of John Bell's children moved to Mississippi in the 1830's. A must-have for classic mystery and ghost story fans!"

It is the first of Ray Bradbury's works to be authorized as an ebook.. In the story, Charles Underhill is a widower who will do anything to protect his young son Jim from the horrors of the playground--a playground which he and the boy pass by daily and the tumult of which, the activity, brings back to Charles the anguish of his own childhood. The playground, like childhood itself, is a nightmare of torment and vulnerability; Charles fears his sensitive son will be destroyed there just as he almost was so many years ago.. Underhill's sister Carol, who has moved in to help raise the young boy after his mother passed away, feels differently. The playground, she believes, is preparation for life, Jim will survive the experience she feels, and he will be the better for it and more equipped to deal with the rigor and obligation of adult existence.. Underhill is caught between his own fear and his sister's invocation of reason and feels paralyzed. A mysterious boy calls out to him from the playground, and seems to know all too well why Underhill is there and what the source of his agony really is. A mysterious Manager also lurks to whom the strange boy directs Underhill. An agreement can be made perhaps--this is what the boy tells Underhill. Perhaps Jim can be spared the playground, but of course, a substitute must be found.. ABOUT THE AUTHOR. Ray Bradbury was a rabid and devoted science fiction fan from his early adolescence and from his early years of the Los Angeles Fiction Society. He sold his first story (a collaboration with Henry Haase) to Future Science Fiction when he was only nineteen years old and by the end of the 1940s was one of the most admired science fiction writers. The irony or paradox of Bradbury's career was that it was, at least in his mind, an essential failure. Bradbury's poetic, impressionistic, surreal, and decidedly non-rational stories were deemed unsuitable by John W. Campbell's Astounding science fiction magazine, and virtually all of his early work went to second and third level magazines for publication.. In the postwar years, Bradbury's short stories found home in the so-called mainstream magazines; Mademoiselle, Charm, Redbook, Esquire, and the like, and he became the first science fiction writer to achieve some significant literary recognition through publication in Martha Foley's Best American Short Stories and the O. Henry Prize volumes. Bradbury's first ""novel""--actually a collection of related short stories compiled from work he had published in Planet, Future, and Thrilling Wonder Stories--was published by Doubleday in 1950 and has never been out of print since. It was the basis for both a television feature and a theatrical film.. The collections which followed, “The Illustrated Man” and “A Medicine for Melancholy” among others, were also successful, as was Bradbury's early novel, Something Wicked This Way Comes (also the basis for a Disney film produced in the 1980s). Bradbury collaborated with John Huston in the early 1950s on a film treatment of Moby Dick, and many of his short stories have been the basis for television and theatrical films, notably the feature-length The Wonderful Ice-Cream Suit."

When they stop for the afternoon in sleepy Lone Cone (Pop. 317), they’re charmed by the quaint tourist town which is filled with B&Bs, candy stores, and gift shops. . But the folksy hospitality will vanish as the sun drops behind the mountains. A winter storm is approaching, and the Stahls couldn’t have picked a worse night of the year to get snowed into this perfect little town with a dark, dark secret.. From the author of DESERT PLACES, ABANDON, and SERIAL UNCUT comes this 12,000-word horror novella, which also contains an interview with Blake, excerpts from all four of his novels, and a bonus excerpt of SERIAL UNCUT. . About the Author:. BLAKE CROUCH was born near the piedmont town of Statesville, North Carolina in 1978. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and graduated in 2000 with degrees in English and Creative Writing. Blake is the author of four novels and numerous short stories. He lives with his family in southwest Colorado, where he is at work on a new book. . Praise for Blake Crouch’s ABANDON:. ABANDON would make an excellent movie, switching back and forth between the plain-but-sturdy homes, saloon and church in 1893 and the same structures rotting to dust in 2009...a clever dual story. CHARLOTTE OBSERVER. ABANDON [is] two separate works of past and present seamlessly melded together into a single novel that demands to be read in one sitting, so you can better appreciate the beauty of Crouch’s storytelling…[O]ne of those books that almost instantly puts you in the mind of a classic.BOOKREPORTER . Haunting, fast-paced, and thoroughly engrossing... ABANDON is one of the most original tales of ghosts, greed and gold I've come across. Crouch aligns both eras so perfectly, it's as if the characters are occupying the same breath within the space/time continuum. ABANDON will be one of the most talked-about books of the summer.THE MADISON COUNTY HERALD . Ambitious…the palpable suspense just keeps building, and many thriller fans—especially those who like a touch of horror—will lose sleep to find out how it all ends.BOOKLIST. ABANDON is terrific…a great storyteller hitting his stride.LEE CHILD"

[Siren Menage Amour: Erotic Western Menage a Trois Romance, M/F/M] Epitome of pure evil, born without a heart, soul, or conscience...even his parents did not claim him.An outlaw who takes what he wants...The moment Devin Spawn stumbles upon the exquisite beauty bathing alone in a river, he wants her. Morality non-existent, yet he struggles to keep his distance. His sexual excesses and massive proportions would be too much for the tiny girl who appears more waifish and innocent than womanly.A widow with so much to give...The instant Megan Spawn feels his heated touch and potent sensuality, her flesh burns with wanton desires. It matters little he is the devilishly handsome outlaw known as the Devil's Spawn, the most feared, lethal gunslinger in the West -- and her stepson.Together they risk everything in the devil's playground...Where sexuality is as untamed as the bloodthirsty savages roaming the western frontier, and childhood sweetheart Caleb Walker is guilty as sin, the dark side of lust and passionate surrender comes at a hefty price when the three forge a Devil's Pact. REVIEW for Devil's Pact""Devin Spawn is an outlaw. Given away at birth by his father, Devin travels to his father's ranch to find out why. When he gets close, he comes across a tiny, beautiful woman bathing in the river. Since he has the devil inside of him, Devin does the one thing that comes natural to him--he seduces and makes her his own. There is one thing Devin doesn't know. He has just had relations with his stepmother. Megan Spawn has had a tough life. Rescued from a life of drudgery by her now deceased husband, she wants to spend her life caring for her stepdaughters and possibly being able to have a relationship with the town doctor, her first love, Caleb Walker. That is, until she is touched by the outlaw known as Devil's Spawn. Caleb Walker has loved Megan ever since she was a little girl. When his family caught them in the barn when they were teenagers and sent him away, Caleb has despaired of ever being able to be with Megan. He loves her and is willing to give her time. However, with the arrival of Devin Spawn, time may be running out because it seems that no matter how much Caleb loves her, she might not be his for the taking. Megan and Devin enter into a carnal relationship like none before. Their coming together is sensual and passionate. It is harsh and bold. But where does Caleb fit into this equation? Caleb and Devin enter into a pact, a pact where Caleb becomes part of the pair to make a triad. While Devil's Pact wasn't the tender and enchanting menage that I have grown used to reading, it still engrossed me cover to cover, and with the book being over 180,000 words, that is saying quite a lot. In all honesty, I didn't put it down. Samantha Cruise has written a menage unlike any I have read and I plan to read anything else she releases. She caught my attention with Devil's Pact and I think she will hold it for a long time."" --Talia Ricci, Joyfully Reviewed"
